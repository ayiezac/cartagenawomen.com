A number of users have admittedly claimed that these two sites offer a lot of convenience to them in their pursuit for love. They both offer matchmaking services, but they can be distinguished by a lot of differences.</p>

        </figure>

        <p><b>Craigslist</b> is an online advertisement website devoted to community posts, housing, jobs, items for sale, services, and discussion forums. Craig Newmark began the service in the year 1995. </p>

        <p>It celebrates continuous growth by expanding the sites to 70 more countries. The community taking advantage of the services of Craigslist is growing, however, others have become victims of fake posts and scams from other users making it not a secure place to be online.</p>

        <h3>Personals are Random</h3>
        <p>Cartagena Women has a host company. Meanwhile, Craigslist does not have one. This is the major difference between the two. For Craigslist, the absence of a host company does not give a guarantee to users of the legitimacy and authenticity of the personals posted on the site. In the matchmaking process, no one mediates between users.</p>

        <p>Since no one takes charge to screen and authenticate the personals, they are all random. When using this site, your security can be at high risk. In fact, reported incidents of kidnapping and sexual assaults in which Craigslist is involved have grown in number over the years.</p>

        <h3>Profiles are Not Verified</h3>
        <p>The accounts on the site are not verified. This is another downside of Craigslist. Using the site with unverified personals is a huge disadvantage. Anyone who wishes to create a profile on the site is not required to link their accounts to any other social media accounts. It’s extremely likely that most of the profiles there are fake.</p>

        <h3>Meetups are Not Secured</h3>

        <p>Being open and accessible to anyone, your security in meeting up with people from the site is at stake. It has been reported that fake accounts are already crowding the site. No one would want to risk their life to any kinds of trouble or crime as mentioned earlier and has been reported in the past.</p>
