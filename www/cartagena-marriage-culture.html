            <p>Marriage culture in Cartagena reflects the authentic <a href="/culture-traditions-of-cartagena-women.htm">culture and traditions</a> of Latin American ancestry. Moreover, the way Colombians practice the sacred union is greatly influenced by the teachings of the Roman Catholic denomination.</p>

            <p>In Cartagena, a series of events take place before the wedding day. Apparently, one of those is the customary bridal shower. The bride will be given a variety of monogrammed items to use for in her new households, such as towels, bed sheets, and table clothes.</p>

            <p>A <i>Serenata</i> is also done by the groom to the bride the night before the wedding. During this event, the family and close friends of both sides congregate in the bride's house to drink <i>Aguardiente</i> - an all-time Colombian favorite anise-flavored liquor - eat mini empanadas, and gift the couple with silver goods such as plates, platters, and tea sets. The night is filled with traditional ranchera love songs.</p>

            <p>On the wedding day, the church becomes a garden full of flowers - as well as the venue of the reception, which is usually held in a hotel, hacienda, or backyard. In a Colombian wedding, there are no groomsmen or bridesmaids. The bride will be accompanied by little flower girls wearing floral wreaths and carrying little baskets filled with petals, and a page boy carrying a cushion with the blessed gold rings and <i>Arras</i> covered in a piece of lace which will later be used as the first child's christening hat, following the Las Arras tradition. </p>

            <p>After exchanging rings and vows, the couple lights a candle together, signifying their union as one body, and dance out of the church holding the lit candle. Right after the sacred rites, people proceed to the venue reception where the second part of the ceremony is done. This is observed almost like how other cultures do the reception after the more solemn wedding ceremony. A typical Cartagena reception is filled with music, dance, food, and wine. Latin people are a huge fan of dancing. It comes as no surprise if they celebrate weddings with Salsa, Merengue, Cumbia, Vallenato and the like.</p>
