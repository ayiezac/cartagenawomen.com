    With all of the  disastrous dating downfalls all around, there are instances when Colombian women tend to feel hopeless about meeting their ideal man. 
  </p>
 
  <p>
    Single guys may be countless, but the ones that meet the standards of Colombian women may be few if focusing on domestic dating alone. Other people who have never dated Cartagena women may say that their standards are too high and this can be the reason why local Colombian men can't keep up with them. 
  </p>
 
  
  <p>
    
Latina women in Colombia want a man who is faithful. The majority of beautiful Colombian women prefer to be in a monogamous relationship. With the rising infidelity rate reaching closely three-quarters among Latinos, single Colombian girls tend to lose hope in finding a faithful partner. 
  </p>
 
  
  <p>
    
Many Colombian women say that they prefer to be single instead of being married to someone who is irresponsible. Colombianas want a responsible man because they seek a firm foundation for their family in the future. It's a Latina culture to always prioritize the welfare of their families.

  </p>
 
  
  <p>
    These are two of the values most Colombian women for marriage look for in a single guy. Do you think this is too much?
  </p>
 
  
  <p>
    
For over two decades of dating men who go on singles tours, women in Colombia find out that it is still possible to guaranty a match with a man that has values they want in a partner. Often, it's the international couple that has the possibility to last longer compared to the local Colombian couples. This scenario explains why dating in Colombia is now ruled by single men who travel to South America with pure intentions.
