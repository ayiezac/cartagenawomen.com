  <p>
 
Despite the negativities that you may come across on the internet about dating Colombian women in Cartagena, there are still countless intercultural relationships with Colombian girls that are successful. 

  </p>
 
  
  <p>
    
It's been known around the globe that most Colombian women are among the friendliest, warmest, and inviting people in the world. All of the advantages found dating in South America are discussed several times and there can be instances where  men create unrealistic expectations before venturing into Cartagena. 
  </p>
 
  
  <p>
    Of course, dating Latina women towards a successful Colombian marriage will always be worth it, but realistic expectations will get more men to this goal than assuming Colombia to be a fairytale situation.
