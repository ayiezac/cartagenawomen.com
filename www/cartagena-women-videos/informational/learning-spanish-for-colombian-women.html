    Dating Colombian girls can be quite exciting for foreigners, but what happens with first dates? Maybe a candlelit dinner date but what if the man can't speak any Spanish?
  </p>
 
  <p>
    When dating other cultures, the expectation is that both parties have some understanding of the other's language to make that genuine connection they both dream of. When a man attends a singles tour in Cartagena, he does not need to be a Spanish aficionado nor does he have to know easy Spanish, he can simply interact and communicate via matchmakers and interpreters.
  </p>
 
  
  <p>
    But to have a great first date in Colombia, learning Spanish isn't needed. 
  </p>
 
  
  <p>
    You're already in Cartagena, attending meet and greets with gusto and confidence, and that is a plus for Colombian women who appreciate boldness in men. 
  </p>
 
  
  <p>
    When it comes down to it, Latina girls, especially Colombian women, love the novelty of a foreign man just beginning to learn Spanish--it's a hidden adventure for every man dating in Colombia. 
  </p>
 
  
  <p>
    With Colombian women, the best way to learn Spanish is the natural way, through finding a partner and practicing speaking to them. 
  </p>
 
  
  <p>
    It's a "Romance" language after all.
  </p>
 
  
  <p>
    What's more impressive and attractive to Colombian women than a man who is daring and adventurous. Most Latinas view flying to a new country and learning Spanish to be the best way a man can guaranty a match!
