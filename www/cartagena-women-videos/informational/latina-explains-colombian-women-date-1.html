  <p>Passport bros from around the globe are eager to date Colombian women in Cartagena.</p>
  <p>Due to the countless successful stories of finding a bride in Latin America, many men are also driven to start looking for love in Colombia with the hopes of finding a loving traditional Latina girlfriend.</p>
  <p>Dating beyond borders has become one of the most popular things to do in Colombia among solo travelers, passport bros and even expats settling in Cartagena.</p>
  <p>Through a life-changing Colombia trip, men have the chance to meet and date as many Latina women as they can. The warm personality of most Colombian women can sometimes be overwhelming to foreign men who find dissatisfaction with their domestic dating experiences, often echoed by movements like MGTOW / Red Pill or passport bros.</p>
  <p>Due to this cultural difference, Colombian girls are sometimes misunderstood as easy because they easily get along well with tourists who travel to Cartagena.</p>
  <p>However, if you take a closer look at it, thereâ€™s a big difference in how Colombian women treat those who are dear to their hearts.</p>
  <p>Another difference men experience in Colombian culture is how Latinas are willing to date even if they do not speak any English. Often on first dates, Colombian girls will bring an interpreter with them, but many modern Latinas are using their smartphones to translate during dates with foreigners, depending on their comfort level.</p>
  <p>This scenario has been misunderstood by people from different cultures. There are people who think interpreters want a free meal and other misconceptions. The truth is Colombian women want to feel safe and comfortable, especially when meeting someone dating beyond borders.</p>
