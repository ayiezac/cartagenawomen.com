  <p>
    To most foreigners, Colombia is a land full of danger, vice, where everyone, especially those beautiful Colombian women, are out to get the hapless foreigner. 
  </p>
 
  <p>
    But how true is that exactly? 

  </p>
 
  
  <p>
    There is a large rumor mill about Colombia, continuously churning out lies and fabrications about how dangerous the country is and how the people are just born liars. The worst of these rumors describe how Colombian women are wily seductresses who will take everything from a man, right down to his underwear, if just given the chance. 

  </p>
 
  
  <p>
    There are even men on the internet who purport to have been scammed while in Cartagena, accosted by Cartagena girls and seduced into giving up all the money in their wallet! Some men even claim that Colombian women just want a foreign man to get free access to their country! 

  </p>
 
  
  <p>
    These simply are not true all across the board. 

  </p>
 
  
  <p>
    Colombian women among Latina girls are some of the sweetest, most passionate people to be around with. For men that dream of making connections with caring, loving and extremely faithful women, you can't screw up with having Colombian women as partners. 
  </p>
 
  
  <p>
    So, don't believe in what the mainstream media will tell you. Do your own research and see for your own eyes how Colombian women can be. 
  </p>
 
  
  <p>
    Meet and greets have their own problems, and not every fish will get caught, but one thing for certain is that these kinds of dating events always accomplish their goal: getting honest, single men a chance to guaranty that ideal match among hundreds of lovely Colombian women. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Some men strike out, some men get a homerun, but deep connections are still made. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Love beyond borders does exist, but only if you tune out the noise and take that risk. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Meet alluring and passionate Colombian women in Cartagena!
