        <h1>Why Making an Itinerary Is Essential</h1>

        <p><i>“Not all those who wander are lost”</i> (J. R. R. Tolkien). But every wanderer needs an itinerary. The journey will look like a piece of cake because it can help you do the following:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The itinerary can help maximize your time. You have to estimate the travel time to certain numerous attractions and be prepared for unforeseen circumstances, like weather conditions and traffic.</li>
            <li>When traveling, you should be aware of your expenses. The travel itinerary makes it easy for you to plan your budget ahead. </li>
            <li>The internet can provide a visual of the places you want to visit; it looks easy on your screen, but in reality, it’s not. Map your destinations using your itinerary. Prioritize your wants. But if distance is the issue, then you have to adjust and visit the places near each other.</li>
            <li>Everything you need for the trip will be with you. Writing the essentials (clothes, medicines, gadgets, emergency numbers, etc.) down on your itinerary makes it easy for you to check if you did not miss a thing.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Planning ahead months before the travel is good, and planning where to go at a certain time of the year is important. South America has a lot of places worth visiting. One of which is Cartagena in Colombia.</p>
