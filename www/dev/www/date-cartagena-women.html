        <p><a href="/women/cartagena-women/cartagena-women.htm">Cartagena women</a> are dynamic and unpredictable. They will never fail to surprise a man and that they are beyond what one can expect. However, they still live up to their country's norm in dating.</p>

        <p>Here are five key points on the prevailing dating etiquette Cartagena women uphold that you have to understand before going out on a date with one. </p>

        <p><b>The Hard to Get Game</b></p>
        <p>Cartagena women love to play hard to get and men love chasing. If you are a serious man wanting to win her heart, you have to play the game well. It might be hard to get her in the first chase, but it is going to be worth the effort and time. However, bouquets of flowers and old-school tactics still work for Cartagena women. </p>

        <p><b>Chivalry is Alive</b></p>
        <p>Colombian men typically ask a woman out on a date, pay for it, and take her home. It may sound like old-school, but it makes them feel very manly and in charge. Because of this, Cartagena women specifically expect all men to do the same. Like many societies in the world, a nice bachelor means having a courteous attitude and behavior towards women. A Cartagena woman loves the idea of chivalry.</p>

        <p><b>Strong Familial Attachment</b></p> 
        <p>Family is everything --- Cartagena people strongly believe in this. Family is the most important aspect of life for most of them. It tends to have a major influence on individuals, especially for Cartagena women, since they are known to be family-oriented. There is a general expectation placed upon them to be loyal and committed to their family by putting the interests of the family above their own. Hence, it greatly affects their decisions in life. This undeniably affects their ideals of a date.</p>   

        <h2>Dating Deal Breakers for Cartagena Women</h2>  
        <p>You probably have ideas now on what turns off a Cartagena woman out from knowing her dating etiquette. This will help you set a favorable position with your potential date. Continue to read through this page to know some crucial points you need to AVOID so as not to break the deal off.</p>

        <p><b>1.Having no serious commitment.</b></p>
        <p>Cartagena women are faithful. They are committed to establishing a serious and lifetime relationship. They do not like to just play around. They are for long-term relationships rather than just for casual dating. If you want to pursue a single Cartagena woman, you need to have serious intentions and commitment.  </p>

        <p><b>2. Taking sexual advantages over her.</b></p>
        <p>Cartagena women, like most Latinas, are undeniably hot. However, having a conservative upbringing, it would be a major turn off if you see her as sexual material. She prefers to take things at a slow pace. They date with high hopes of finding a husband they will spend the rest of their lives with. Show to her that your intentions are true and you are not just after sexual pleasures from her. </p>

        <p><b>3.Dishonesty and disrespect.</b></p>
        <p>Right attitude precedes right behavior. Being honest begets trust and respect. When in a serious commitment, <a href="/more-single-cartagena-girls.htm">Cartagena girls</a> try their best to be honest, loyal, and devoted partners. These qualities are what they are looking for a man as well. You need to be honest with her in most things while still keeping respect towards her. You should also know the appropriate <a href="/cartagena-questions-to-ask.html/">questions to ask Cartagena women</a>. Be genuine and desirable. </p>

        <p><b>4. Unhygienic lifestyle.</b></p>
        <p>Colombians, in general, are very particular about being clean. They are very keen when it comes to sanitation; they take very good care of their body, so if you date Cartagena women, you can never be messy. Never fail to check yourself in front of the mirror if you are dressed well and with proper hygiene.</p>

        <p><b>5. No clear future plans.</b></p>
        <p>Financial matters don't really matter so much for Cartagena women. However, these women are future-oriented. This is drawn back to their strong family orientation. They have bright plans for the future, and they have been working on it long since they have been capable. Choosing the right guy to share their life with is one of their crucial decisions in life. Do not be surprised if a Cartagena woman asks you about your future plans; you must be clear with it.</p>
