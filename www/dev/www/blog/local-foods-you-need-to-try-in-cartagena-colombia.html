    <p> When we're traveling, we can't deny the fact that we're not only excited about the tourist destinations that we aim to visit. But also to be able to experience the food in whichever country we plan on visiting. It's one way to tour the city and meet <a href="/women/cartagena-women/cartagena-women.htm">Cartagena women</a> and another way to enjoy local street foods.</p>    

    <p> Street stalls are very common in their city and they are different from each other. You can also find vendors in bicycle vending stations, push carts, and some even walk around the area to sell food. <a href="/why-travel-to-cartagena.htm">Cartagena Colombia</a> offers a lot of delicacies. And on this page, we are going to look at the best of them.</p>

    <p> Without further ado, here it is:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Arepa de Huevo</b> - Known as Cartagena's most popular street food. This is beyond their average arepa --- which is a bread part of the culture of Colombia and is perfect for breakfast or snack.</li>
      <p>Furthermore, Arepa de Huevo is also stuffed with egg and ground beef. But if you're a vegetarian, they also serve it without meat.</p>

      <li><b>Patacon con Queso</b> - This is a type of patty but unlike the usual patty that we know, this is made of green plantains and it's crispy too. Also, it comes with cheese and suero.</li>
      <p>If you'd want to fully experience the culture of Colombia, it's a must for you to try this. </p>

      <li><b>Patacon con Todo</b> - Are you into pizzas? Then give this one a try. The base of this is also made of green plantains and what's in it is a mix of chicken, chorizo, butifarra, shredded beef, pork, and cheese. But that's not it, on top of all that are crispy potato sticks and a full complement of sauces.</li>
      <p>And if you're planning for a late date with Colombian women, then this is a perfect midnight snack.</p>

      <li><b>Grilled Arepa con Queso</b> - Yes, the arepa is a popular food in Cartagena. And it comes in many forms and flavors.</li>
      <p>What makes this one different is the fact that it's grilled and it's filled with cheese. You will see a lot of vendors grilling this beside the street. And if you're a fan of cheese, you're sure to enjoy the gooey filling of this one. </p>

      <li><b>Papa Rellena</b> - The sound of this might not be familiar to you. But you might have tried this before in Western countries. Basically, papa rellenas are made of mashed potatoes and under it is filled with ground beef. Some vendors fill it with egg and ground beef and we highly suggest you try both. </li>
      <p>This is a perfect snack that you can take any time of the day. And it's a constant proof that potatoes and meat are loved by people all throughout the globe.</p>

      <li><B>Raspao</B> - If you're feeling hot on a sunny day. Indulge yourself with Raspao. So, basically, it's the same as ice cream but with a twist as they'll add condensed milk on top.</li>
      <p>And what's so unique about getting one in Cartagena is the fact that they still make this the traditional way.</p>
    </ul>
