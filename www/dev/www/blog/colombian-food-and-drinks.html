  <p>When you join our world-famous singles vacation to Cartagena, Colombia, your trip wouldn’t be complete without trying some <a href="/blog/must-try-colombian-food.html">Colombian food</a>. But while you’re having your fill of ceviche, bandeja paisa, and mondongo, you might as well pair them with some of the best drinks the country has to offer. </p>

  <p>There’s more to Colombian beverages than tequila, margarita, and mojitos. To get a taste of some authentic Cartagena cocktails, these are the drinks you must try:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Aguardiente</b></li>
    <p>This liquor is widely considered as the national drink of Colombia. <a href="/women/cartagena-women/cartagena-women.htm">Cartagena women</a> are particularly fond of this drink and is usually prepared during national holidays and other important occasions. </p>
    <p>The name translates to “fire water” and is made from sugarcane. To get a distinct taste, this beverage is flavored with aniseed which produces a drink with 29% proof (or alcohol content). Aguardiente is particularly popular among areas near the Caribbean; so your trip to the beach wouldn’t be complete without tasting this drink.</p>

    <li><b>Ron Viejo de Casas</b></li>
    <p>If Aguardiente is crowned as Colombia’s favorite beverage, then rum is regarded as the first runner up. It’s no wonder considering Colombian rums are high in quality. </p>
    <p>But out of all of them, the top brands would have to be Ron Viejo de Casas and Ron Medellin Añejo. However, it is also one of the priciest drinks, so expect it to be more expensive than most.</p>

    <li><b>Birra</b></li>
    <p>On a hot summer day, there’s nothing more satisfying than sipping on a mug of ice-cold beer. And you certainly won’t regret sipping on the lagers of Colombia. </p>
    <p>The most popular brands would have to be Aguila, Pilsen, and Costeña. Lately, though, a number of microbreweries have been crafting their own blend, which means you have more beers to choose from.</p>

    <li><b>Refajo</b></li>
    <p>Colombians have figured out how to mix and match certain beverages to make some tasty cocktails. Refajo is a perfect example of this. Comprised of local beer and sodas, what you get is a perfectly creamy and fizzy concoction. This cocktail is the perfect companion to any asado dish.</p>

    <li><b>Canelazo</b></li>
    <p>Since Aguardiente is quite popular among <a href="/women/colombian/colombian-women.htm">Colombian women</a>, it’s not surprising that the locals concocted cocktails out of it. One of the most popular is Canelazo. Comprised of cinnamon, lime juice, cloves, warm aguanpale (which is water with melted sugar cane and Aguardiente, this fruity and zesty drink is perfect for those chilly evenings.</p>

    <li><b>Chicha</b></li>
    <p>Corn is one of the most staple crops in the country. So much so that they can make drinks out of it. Chicha is made out of fermented corn, sugar, and honey (in some cases with pineapple), which makes it one of the sweetest cocktails around. </p>
    <p>Although it isn’t as mainstream in major cities as Aguardiente, it is quite popular among rural areas. If you are still curious enough to try it out, there are still some bars that serve Chicha.</p>
  </ul>

  <p>With these drinks, it’s clear that the Colombian food menu of drinks is diverse. But instead of just learning about all these Colombian food recipes, you might as well sample authentic Colombian food by visiting the country.  </p>
