  <p>The port city of Cartagena is one of the most well-known cities in Colombia. That’s because it is a cultural and historical haven. It even served as the inspiration for Macondo from Gabriel Garcia Marquez’s novel One Hundred Years of Solitude. Today, it is a bustling metropolis that effortlessly blends the old with the new.</p>

Eligible bachelors from different parts of the world visit Cartagena hoping to meet Colombia’s best.</p>

  <p>You, too, can join a <a href="/tour/cartagena/">Colombian singles tour</a> in order to find your future partner. There are several that can take you to the famous city of Cartagena, Colombia. But before even embarking on such a journey, list these Cartagena travel tips first to ensure a smooth sailing trip:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Avoid drinking too much.</b></li>
    <p>For most people who travel to developing countries for the first time, safety is usually their primary concern. So if you’re asking Is Cartagena safe? Well, it is a fairly safe city, but that’s not a reason not to keep your wits about it. </p>
    <p>So when you are out exploring, keep your alcohol consumption to a minimum. You need to have a presence of mind in order to navigate the city. Also, you are in an unfamiliar territory among people you barely know. You don’t want perpetrators to take advantage of you while you’re drunk.</p>

    <li><b>Plan a contingency.</b></li>
    <p>You never know what could go wrong while you’re on a trip. Your luggage might get lost, the weather might turn for the worst, several attractions might be closed, your hotel might be fully booked, you end up injuring yourself, you name it. </p>
    <p>Whether any of these unforeseen circumstances happen or not, you want to have sufficient coverage anyway. That is why you should consider procuring insurance before you leave for the trip. Fortunately, there are various travel insurance packages you can choose from that would suit your needs.</p>

    <li><b>Explore in crowded places.</b></li>
    <p>There is nothing wrong with going off on your own. However, there is also safety in numbers. There have been solo travelers that have been singled out by robbers and pickpockets. </p>
    <p>To avoid being targeted, it would be better to explore places with other people around. If you can, you should also consider befriending a few people so you can travel together. Another benefit of this arrangement is that you look out for each other.</p>

    <li><b>Spend wisely.</b></li>
    <p>Always be mindful of your finances while traveling. Before you leave for your trip, list down all the necessary expenses, such as flight fares, hotel rate, meals, public transportation, admission fees, and an emergency fund. Doing so not only determines how much you need to save for the trip but also how much you can spend on other expenditures, such as shopping for souvenirs or paying for spa services.</p>

    <li><b>Go with the flow.</b></li>
    <p>An itinerary is merely a guide. It simply lets you know what you have planned during the day. However, whenever something more worthwhile comes up then take the plunge. You never know what you’re missing out until you try. During your <a href="/why-travel-to-cartagena.htm">Colombia travel</a> holiday, give yourself some leeway to try some new things that aren’t part of your itinerary.</p>
  </ul>

  <p>As long as you follow these tips, you can make the most out of your singles tour in Cartagena. So go ahead and travel to Cartagena and you may just meet the woman of your dreams.</p>
