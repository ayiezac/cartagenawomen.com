        <p> Feel like you need a little boost with your Latina sweetheart in terms of intimacy? </p>

        <p> Knowing how to maintain intimacy in a relationship is just as important as being a committed partner. There are many factors that can either contribute to or hinder physical affection. It could be that you are no longer interested in any sexual activity, or romance has simply died out and you’ve decided to do nothing about it. </p>

        <p> It’s more than just building a strong sense of <a href="/blog/cartagena-women-values-needed-for-a-relationship-to-flourish.html">emotional intimacy</a>. Craving physical affection is perfectly normal, and although we all have our mood swings every now and then, we should not deprive ourselves from such a basic need.  </p>

        <p> The fact that you care about maintaining intimacy with your Latina girlfriend is enough to show that you want to keep her happy.  </p>

        <p> However, you should know by now <a href="https://cratedwithlove.com/blog/five-love-languages-and-what-they-mean/">what her love languages are</a> so that it would be easier for you to please her. No matter how long you’ve been together as a couple, always find ways to connect with her, regardless of her cultural-related tendencies.   </p>

        <p> Aside from having a great sex life, it’s equally important to be on the same wavelength when it comes to emotions, intellect, experiences, and even in spirit. </p>

        <p> Intimacy doesn’t always have to come instantly. You will need to work on it together. Being able to connect with a Latina woman shouldn’t be difficult as long as you are both willing to figure things out as a team. As much as possible, try to avoid waiting for the time to come when you are no longer intimate with each other. </p>

        <p> Remember, when intimacy is gone in a relationship, each of you will eventually question your worth, and worst of all, fall out of love. </p>

        <p> To keep the fire burning in your relationship, consider the following tips and pieces of advice: </p>

        <ol>

        <li><b> Show your gratitude.</b></li>

        <p> If you’ve been dating someone for a considerable length of time, you might have the tendency to take them for granted, including their efforts. Most long term couples are prone to this behavior, so the best way to avoid letting this get the best of your relationship is by saying a simple, genuine “thank you” every now and then. Showing appreciation for your partner can also be done in the form of gifts, gestures, and favors.   </p>

        <li><b> Make time for her.</b></li>

        <p> This may sound basic, but being able to spend time with the woman you love isn’t just about being physically present. It’s also about consciously being with her so you can both engage in something special. There are many meaningful things you can do together that would help enforce your intimacy in different aspects. The point is that you are happy in each other’s company, regardless of what it is you’re doing. </p>

        <li><b>Cuddle.</b></li>

        <p> Sexual intimacy can be so overrated for most couples, but the fact is that the mere act of cuddling can do so much for the sense of closeness that you desire. Not only will you feel safe being in each other’s arms, but you’ll also be content knowing that you have someone who can help bring warmth and passion into your life. This is also considered an innocent way of showing your affection, which will in turn make you both feel truly connected to one another. Plus, cuddling never fails to give you that sweet and romantic vibe. </p>

        <li><b> Delve into deeper talks.</b></li>

        <p> As time goes by, try to normalize having deep talks about your relationship and life in general. Don’t be afraid to show your vulnerabilities and weaknesses as well. Share your thoughts and talk about the things you’re both going through. Always be curious about each other so you can understand one another better, even when you’re in a disagreement. </p>

        <li><b> Add a little twist to your routines.</b></li>

        <p> While you have to embrace what you normally do on a regular basis, trying to prevent your relationship from going stagnant will require you to sometimes avoid the predictable. Trying something new together can be as simple as choosing to dine in a restaurant you haven’t been to before, or as adventurous as skydiving or traveling to another country.  </p>

        <li><b> Give each other a massage.</b></li>

        <p> The next time you need some healing hands, remember your partner. You don’t have to go to a professional when it comes to this as you can always give each other massages instead. It’s a great avenue for you to have conversations, too. Think of it as a sexier and more intimate way to spend your <A href="/blog/latin-women-ideal-ways-to-spend-a-romantic-date.html">date night</A>.  </p>

        <li><b> Share your fantasies.</b></li>

        <p> Sometimes, there are frustrations either one of you may have in bed. Dealing with this by talking about your wild fantasies can help. Don’t be too shy about opening up about it, either. You’ll be doing yourselves a favor when you both sit down and start talking about your fantasies. You don’t have to jump into doing them right away. Simply take it one step at a time. </p>

        <li><b>Spend time apart.</b></li>

        <p> As it turns out, maintaining closeness isn’t just when you hold hands; it’s also when you’re apart. Remember how your heart used to skip a beat seeing your loved one after a long time? Relive that kind of excitement by intentionally spending some time apart, after which you will feel renewed, excited, and wonderfully free again — something that will give your relationship the fresh start it needs. </p>

        <li><b> Cook together.</b></li>

        <p> The simple things you do at home can also be a great way for you to maintain intimacy. You don’t always have to eat out at fancy restaurants; sometimes, staying in and cooking your favorite meals can be equally fun and exciting.  </p>

      </ol>
