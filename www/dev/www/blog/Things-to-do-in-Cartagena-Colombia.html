They are quite fond of heading to bars and clubs and partying until the wee hours of the night. If you decide to visit this city, you should at least try to keep up and experience the nightlife for yourself.</p>
  <p>The city will really come to life after the sun has set. So it goes without saying that partying is definitely one of the best <a href="/helpful-itinerary-for-cartagena.html">things to do in Cartagena Colombia</a>. To truly experience a nightlife unlike any other, make sure to head to these places in Cartagena:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>The bars</b></li>
    <p>The club scene isn’t quite as lively in Cartagena compared to other top tourist destinations. Instead, it’s their bars that take all the glory. That’s because the locals appreciate live musical performances, which are staples in most of the city’s bars.</p>
    <p>Some of the more popular establishments include La Casa de la Cerveza and Donde Fidel. So if you want to listen to authentic Colombian music, there are plenty of bars you can visit. They usually open at around 6 to 7 pm and close at 3 or 4 am. These bars are also ideal places to meet <a href="/how-to-meet-women-in-cartagena.html">Colombian women</a>. </p>

    <li><b>The restaurants</b></li>
    <p>Food is an integral part of the nightlife in Cartagena, Colombia. The city is considered the culinary capital of the country, especially in terms of seafood. Some of the best restaurants are right around the San Diego district. The Getsemani area also has some quality establishments but they cater to customers on a budget. </p>
    <p>And since Cartagena is a port city, expect the seafood to be scrumptious and fresh. Make sure to order the octopus ceviche and fried red snapper, which are two of the most popular dishes in the city.</p>

    <li><b>The bay</b></li>
    <p>The Cartagena bay area is a spectacular sight during the evening. You can enjoy the view of the coast through a boat ride along the bay. If you are with a large group, you can also negotiate with the owner to book a ride all to yourselves. For a romantic excursion, you can board a cruise ship and wine and dine with your date while overlooking the coast.</p>

    <li><b>The festivals</b></li>
    <p>There are plenty of events to look forward to all-year-round. This gives you the perfect reason to visit Cartagena anytime. During January, you can party to quality house music by attending several music festivals. February is ideal for book lovers and movie buffs because that is the time for the annual Hay Festival and movie festival. Finally on March, witness some of the most beautiful women compete against each other in the Miss Colombia pageant.</p>

    <li><b>The clubs</b></li>
    <p>Although bars are more popular in Cartagena, that doesn’t mean that their clubs aren’t worth visiting either. You’ll find them just as lively and upbeat as clubs in other top tourist destinations. Even if the bars are the highlights of the city, it still doesn’t take away from the vibrant and lively vibe of its clubs.</p>
    <p>The most popular club would have to be Cafe Havana because of its retro design and refreshing cocktails. This is where you’ll find stunning <a href=" /women-in-cartagena.html">Cartagena women</a> just dancing their night away. </p>

  <p>There are indeed plenty of things to do at night while you’re in this beautiful city. Even if you miss some of these places, there are still some unusual things to do in Cartagena. You just need to be creative and spontaneous.</p>
