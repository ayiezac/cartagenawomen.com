        <p><i>Love in the Time of Cholera</i>, an internationally acclaimed novel written by a native Colombian author was first published in Spanish in 1985 and was consequently translated in English in 1988. An English-language movie adaptation was released in 2007. It tells the story of a man who never stopped pursuing a love-worthy <a href="/women/cartagena-women/cartagena-women.htm">Cartagena woman</a> for 50 years until he succeeded. </p>

        <p>Garcia Marquez never actually name the setting of his story, but his description of the "city of the Viceroys" is a close match for Cartagena. His descriptions of the setting in the novel paint the picture of a complex and colorful city. Much of the scenes in the 2007 English movie adaptation of the novel were taken in the historic, walled city of Cartagena.</p>

        <p>Marquez’s masterpiece has made Cartagena an ideal setting for love and romance. It continues to draw foreign couples and singles to experience one-of-a-kind love and romance in the city. Cartagena has not only kept some of the most beautiful women in the world, but the most romantic and passionate ones. Know some of the facts on how romantic and passionate they can be in love. </p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>She is hopeless romantic.</b></li>
          <p>You can't blame a girl for loving too hard. A Cartagena woman falls in love too easily or wants to see as good as possible in her relationship. Cartagena women are simply hopeless romantics. They can get hopeless at some points; blame the fact that they are a huge fan of telenovelas. They have viewed life as ridiculously dramatic and romantic as the telenovelas they watch. How they love is how they believed it is.</p>
          <p>This makes them very expressive towards their love. When they are in love, they exert much effort such as making surprises, showing affection through gestures even in public without reservations, and being true most of the time. They are simply romantic. </p>

          <li><b>She is loyal.</b></li>
          <p>Cartagena women are monogamous in nature. Being predominantly a Catholic country, unfaithfulness is a mortal sin. Due to their strong family orientation, they know how to value marriage and close family ties. Building a complete and happy family of their own is their greatest aspiration in life. When a Cartagena woman loves, she loves you with all her heart, capacity and loyalty.</p>

          <li><b>She loves fiercely.</b></li>
          <p>Cartagena women are passionate. They love as fiercely as possible. They are very open and vocal towards many matters. Just as much as she would want you to recognize when she is angry, she wants you to recognize how much she loves you. The love of a Cartagena woman is probably unconditional. When you got one, you are the luckiest, so keep it safe!</p>
        </ul>
