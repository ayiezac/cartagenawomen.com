        <p>The juxtaposition of the ancient and the modern is evident in many aspects of Cartagena. The walls of the old city and the tower blocks and hotel chains of Bocagrande are an ever-present reminder that, despite the city's modern developments, it has kept its humble beginnings.</p>
        <p>In Cartagena, you will concretely see the contrast between old and new. When you are into the treasures of the past, there is certainly a place for you here. If you are, on the other hand, for modern luxuries, it is just everywhere.</p>
