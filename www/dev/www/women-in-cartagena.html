        <p>Colombia is a multiethnic society, home to a diverse group of people of various ethnic, religious and national origins. An immensely diverse city is Cartagena. </p>

        <p>Cartagena was originally inhabited by the Calamari Indians. During the Colonial period, Cartagena’s population was mixed with Spaniards from the conquest and slaves brought from Africa, making it a predominantly Afro-Caribbean, mulatto, and mestizo population.</p>

        <p>There are hundreds of Cartagena women who have joined our site, seeking lifetime commitment from single foreign men. These women possess interesting characteristics which are derived from Colombian culture and traditions.</p>

        <p>These are the stereotypes of Cartagena women. Of course, you can't generalize a whole group of people just because they are from the same place. However, these are some interesting cultural observations you might note about Cartagena women, especially when you decide to pursue one.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Polite</b></li>
          <p>Cartagena women are extremely polite by nature more than others. "Please", "thank you," and "you're welcome" are words you'll definitely want to use here and, they are also words you'll hear quite frequently in many different ways. It is a fact that Colombians, in general, are welcoming and friendly.</p>
          <p>Because of their overwhelming politeness, Cartagena women are utterly gentle and compassionate. Expect to date a respectful and understanding woman.</p>

          <li><b>Happy</b></li>
          <p>Colombia was deemed the happiest country in the world in 2013. Cartagena people demonstrate happiness all the time. They maintain a cheerful countenance and friendly manner towards one another and especially towards foreign people.</p>

          <p>Cartagena women are easy to be with. Your first date with a <a href="/new-cartagena-women.html">single Cartagena woman</a> would certainly be filled with positivity. Keep it that way.</p>

          <li><b>Family Centered and Oriented </b></li>
          <p>Cartagena people like any other Colombians are more than just a coffee and soccer lover, but they are family-centered and oriented. Most Saturdays and Sundays are made for family time and most families in Cartagena are tightly knit with as many as 3 or 4 generations living under one roof.</p>
          <p>When you go out on a date with a Cartagena single, you will consequently get into her home. One of the most effective ways to win her heart is to win her family first. </p>

          <li><b>Creative </b></li>
          <p>Colombians are well represented in both music and the arts. International stars such as Shakira, Sofía Vergara, Danna Garcia, and Juanes all call Colombia home. Counting the brilliant mind behind one of the greatest novels of all time <i>Love in the Time of Cholera</i>, Gabriel García Márquez, and world-renowned sculptor, Fernando Botero have placed Colombia at the center of creative arts in the world.</p>
          <p>It runs in the blood of Cartagena people to be creative and inventive. Exhaust the creative side of yourself when you think of date ideas for a Cartagena woman.</p>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Dance to the beat of music.</b></li>
          <p>Dancing is a fascinating Latin culture. As soon as the beat of salsa, vallenato, or reggaeton will be heard, a typical Cartagena woman could not resist, but to start grooving. It could happen in no time and place. When it happens while you are on a date, even if dancing is not your thing, you've got to give it a try. When she sees you trying your best to jive with her on the dance floor, she will utmostly appreciate your effort.</p>

          <p>Not everything is going to be perfect. Your Cartagena woman can be jealous at times. However, it is a common nature among women to get jealous unreasonably sometimes.

Jealousy comes in as a consequence.</p>

          <li><b>They are in love with the idea of <i>chivalry</i>.</b></li>
          <p>Being the first one to make the move, opening the door for the woman to walk through, pulling out a chair for her and telling her how beautiful she is --- these and other gestures are manifestations of chivalry. Cartagena women are still hopeful they will experience one or two of these things from the man they are dating.
