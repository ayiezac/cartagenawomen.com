  <p>Out of all the countries in South America, Colombia is one of the most contrasting—not just in geography but also in culture.</p>

  <p>It’s also one of the South American countries that still embrace their Murisca and Tairona influences. The result is a rich and vibrant culture that shines throughout the country.</p>

  <p>Should you decide to <a href="/tour/cartagena/">travel to Colombia</a>, we strongly recommend that you make a stop in one of its most lively and exhilarating cities: Cartagena.</p>

  <p>We guarantee that you will not regret visiting Colombia after experiencing this amazing city. </p>

  <h2>About Cartagena</h2>

  <p>Located along the Caribbean coast, Cartagena has 5 major sections, namely the northern area, downtown, San Diego, Getsemane, and Bocagrande.</p>

  <p>Because Cartagena's a larger city, navigating around can be confusing for first time tourists. One way you can avoid getting lost is by familiarizing the different modes of transport available, which are:</p>

  <h2>Taxis</h2>

  <p>Taxis are one of the most convenient modes of transport in <a href="/helpful-itinerary-for-cartagena.html">Cartagena, Colombia</a>.</p>

  <p>Throughout your stay, you will probably be riding taxis most of the time. Just make sure that they are properly licensed by the local Colombian government. Towns in Colombia require that taxis be licensed for the safety of drivers and riders alike. Most taxis found in major cities like Cartagena will almost always be licensed.</p>

  <p>The indicators of a legal taxi are the yellow color and the label “servicio publico” on the plates. The downside of taxis is that they can be a little expensive depending on your budget.</p>

  <p>However, the rates are still cheaper compared to cabs in most Western cities.</p>


  <h2>Mototaxis</h2>

  <p>One thing tourists notice once they <a href="/why-travel-to-cartagena.htm">travel to Cartagena</a> are the droves of motorcycles lining the streets. The locals don’t just ride them for personal use; there are some drivers that take passengers too. </p>

  <p>There are areas in Cartagena that can’t be accessed by buses and even taxis. If you need to visit one of these areas, then mototaxis will be your best bet of going around.</p>

  <h2>Transcaribe</h2>

         If you want to beat the traffic without spending a fortune on taxis, Cartagena, Colombia’s transcaribe is the best way to get around the city. | Image source: <a href=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:PADRON_TCB.jpg> Wiki Commons </a>, licensed under <a href=https://creativecommons.org/licence/by-sa/4.0/> CC BY-SA 4.0 </a>>

  <p>In Cartagena, there are buses and then there’s Transcaribe.</p>

  <p>In order to improve their mode of transport, this bus line (that almost mimics the functions of a subway) was created in 2016. </p>

  <p>These buses have their own routes and even their own designated lanes. This is ideal when you want to avoid rush hour traffic. The mode of payment for a ride is similar to the subway wherein you buy a card and simply load it with credits. </p>

  <p>You can ride a Transcaribe by waiting at the designated SITM terminal for your route.</p>

  <h2>Buses</h2>

  <p>Buses are the most widely used mode of transportation in the city. Unlike the more organized Transcaribe, you can hail buses just about anywhere around Cartagena. </p>
