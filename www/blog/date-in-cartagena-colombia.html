 <p>It’s easy to fall in love with <a href="/why-travel-to-cartagena.htm">Cartagena Colombia</a>, especially when you’re in the company of beautiful <a href="/women-in-cartagena.html">Colombian women</a>. Who wouldn’t fall in love, especially with the city’s scenic landscape? Indeed, the city is practically the perfect romantic getaway.</p>

 <p>You can turn this city into something more memorable though. One of the best <a href="/helpful-itinerary-for-cartagena.html">things to do in Cartagena Colombia</a> is to have a romantic getaway with your Latina girlfriend.
</p>

<p>Pulling off a romantic escapade isn’t as complicated (nor as expensive) as you might think. So you don’t have to be intimidated. But the question is how do you pull it off in the first place. When planning, here are some factors to consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How much time do you have?</li>
  <p>How long will you be in the city for? You have to take this into serious consideration. Think of it like planning an itinerary. The more complicated the activities, the more time it takes to plan and execute. </p>
  <p>So considering that and how long your holiday would last, how much time do you have to spare for this rendezvous? If you only have a day to spare, then your escapade should ideally last for a couple of hours. This way it doesn’t take much of your trip.</p>

  <li>How much would it cost?</li>
  <p>In order to come up with a budget, list down all the resources you will likely need. These don’t just include all the tangible items. You also have to think about other things. For example, does the venue need an admission fee? Are there items you have to rent (like a car or sound system)? Or you could purchase these items yourself (and if you could buy them, how much would they cost you)?</p>
  <p>All in all, listing down the price of everything you need helps you come up with a budget. Incidentally, it could also help you get rid of some stuff you don’t need.</p>

  <li>Where should it be held?</li>
  <p>To pick the right venue, you have to consider the mood you’re trying to set. For example, for a more relaxed and laidback date, you can have it at sunset by the beach. However, if you’re aiming for a more upbeat and fun-filled time, then consider going to karaoke. In short, the perfect venue should depend heavily on what kind of romantic rendezvous you are aiming for.</p>

  <li>What kind of activity would she enjoy?</li>
  <p>This is the most important factor of all. You have to consider her personality when you plan these things out. If she seems introverted, then an adventure-filled excursion probably isn’t her cup of tea. But the good thing is that one of the most ideal characteristics of a Colombian woman is that they are game for almost anything. Still, picking out a romantic activity that will best suit her style and personality is a surefire way to make her remember your romantic vacation.</p>
</ul>

<p>By answering these questions, your planning would go more smoothly. And if you have a successful getaway, you could be on your way to marrying a Colombian woman. The good thing is that there are plenty of romantic spots in Cartagena, so you have a lot of options to choose from for your excursion. </p>
