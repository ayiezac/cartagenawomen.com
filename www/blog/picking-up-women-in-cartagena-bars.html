        <p> Bored with the same old bars and nightclubs near your area? Wondering where the best Cartagena bars are? Have you experienced <a href="https://cartagenawomen.com/helpful-itinerary-for-cartagena.html">planning your trip</a> to the city but have gotten nowhere? </p>

        <p> If you ended up finding this article in your search for the best places to spend a memorable evening, well, you are on the right track. Get ready to witness the brightly colored places, ornaments, and clothing as you experience the incredible Cartagena nightlife.  </p>

        <p> Cartagena has a vibrant environment, as well as a stunning culture and set of traditions. As such, we encourage you to list down a number of exciting things to do in Cartagena. Have a blast, join our singles vacation tours, and meet Cartagena women. </p>

        <p> Many foreign men are seeking out dating advice on <a href="https://cartagenawomen.com/cartagena-dating-culture.html">picking up women</a> in Colombia. </p>

        <p> Approaching a woman can be quite a task if you don’t have the confidence and motivation to do so, especially if it’s your first time exploring Cartagena. There are rules to be implemented in order for your date with a Colombian woman to go smoothly. </p>

        <p> If you want to find the perfect woman, we suggest that you utilize the use of matchmaking services rather than go for the cold approach. WHY? Because there is a higher success rate of getting to be in a relationship with the woman you're looking for. </p>

        <H2> Cold Approach vs Matchmaking </H2>

        <ol>

          <li><b> Be yourself and dress properly. </b></li>

            <ul>

              <li><b> Cold Approach </b></li>
                
              <p> It's a given that you have to be honest right from the start. Other than that, just be yourself. It takes time to introduce yourself so that your lady will have a better understanding of who you are, and it also takes time to find your similarities. One particular drawback to this approach is that you might trouble yourself on what to wear because you don’t know what your lady's taste in men’s fashion is. </p>

              <li><b> Matchmaking </b></li>
                
              <p> Utilizing a matchmaker makes all these things easier and more convenient for you. You can relate to one another and find a topic to talk about, and since it's all written in your online profile, your match can just read it and ask questions as she goes along. </p>

              <p> You have the opportunity to interact with a suitable mate who shares a lot of similarities with you, and it wouldn't even take that long to have a better understanding of one another. You will know what her taste in fashion is, and you can impress her when you meet in person. </p>

              <p> In other words, matchmaking gives faster, more accurate, and higher chances of having a long lasting relationship with a woman who matches your preferences. </p>

            </ul>

          <li><b>Is it lust or love?</b></li>

            <ul>

              <li><b>Cold Approach</b></li>

              <p> When you're in a bar, a lot of things can happen. It's not really a suitable place to find love. Most people in a bar are out to have a good time and enjoy the night, and that’s it. The percentage of people finding love in a bar is close to none. Hookups and one night stands have a higher chance rate.  </p>

              <li><b>Matchmaking</b></li>

              <p> The point of matchmaking is to FIND true love. The fact that you signed up for one tells it all. It means that you are tired of keeping up with this new trend wherein you can find genuine love at a bar. You're expecting more than just meaningless relationships.  </p>

              <p> You should be looking for a real potential partner. This also signifies that you are ready for a committed relationship, and no more of those childish games. </p>

            </ul>

          <li><b> Be upfront about wanting a committed relationship.</b></li>

        <ul>

          <li><b>Cold Approach</b></li>

            <p>Approaching women at a bar has a low success rate of getting to be in a committed relationship. No one wants to be committed to someone they just met, especially when they don't know what their real intentions are. You would be interacting with a total stranger at a place where alcohol and having fun are pretty much what goes around. </p>  

            <li><b>Matchmaking</b></li>

            <p> The intentions are genuine and real. You can’t really say that the woman you'll be matched with is a total stranger. You have already been provided with a profile and biography, so it's basically like a summary of who that woman is. So anyone who signs up for a matchmaking service is indeed ready for a committed relationship.</p>

          </ul>
        </ol>

        <H3> Benefits of Matchmaking Services </H3>

        <ul>

          <li><b>A Personal Touch</b></li>

          <p> Matchmaking will not only present you at your best, but you will also be advised on how to have the best dates. It is less of a hassle to have someone work for you. You can just kick back and relax as you wait for your perfect partner to pop up. All you need to do is sign up and answer some basic questions about yourself. </p>

          <li><b>Safety</b></li>
            
          <p> The number one concern of every person when meeting someone for the first time is safety. With matchmaking, it is proven and tested that the person you will meet has genuine feelings, not a scammer or a random person with an unknown background. Your security is assured at all times.  </p>

          <li><b>Certainty</b></li>

          <p> The chances of finding “the real deal” are pretty high. It's even okay to have high expectations when it comes to matchmaking. The people you will be matched with are just as invested as you are in finding love. You can be matched with a partner who shares the same dreams and goals as you. </p>

          <li><b>Experience</b></li>

          <p> If you still have doubts, you can always reach out to people who have experienced taking part in matchmaking services. You can review various testimonies and witness the coming together of two strangers who managed to forge a deep and lasting connection. </p>

          <li><b>Feedback</b></li>

          <p> As humans, it's normal for us to make mistakes. So if you encounter a disappointing experience, you can always help a matchmaking agency improve so that you will never have to go through another troubling experience again. </p>

        </ul>

        <H4> Summary </H4>

        <p> Bars may not be a suitable place to find love, but it is most suitable for having FUN. You can enjoy the live music and festivities Cartagena has to offer. We also encourage you to visit a place called Donde Fidel. It is the most famous corner in Cartagena which is located in front of the Clock Tower Plaza.  </p>

        <p> Make it a memorable experience. Impress Cartagena women by dancing. You don’t have to be an expert, just move your feet and sway your hips to the beat. Once you feel like you’ve done everything, that’s a job well done. </p>

        <p> Explore the many exciting <a href="https://cartagenawomen.com/blog/Things-to-do-in-Cartagena-Colombia.html">Cartagena bars</a>, meet the ladies, have confidence, and look forward to having a number of incredible experiences. But if genuine love is your ultimate end goal, you might as well sign up for a matchmaking service such as ours. </p>
