  <p>Although <a href="/why-travel-to-cartagena.htm">Cartagena Colombia</a> has a rather tragic history, the city is now a major Latin American tourist destination - a far cry from its turbulent past. Incidentally, it is also one of the premier date destinations in the world. While not as well known as Medellin or Bogota, there are tidbits about the city that you might find interesting, such as:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Early beginnings</b></li>
    <p><a href="/history-of-cartagena.html">Historical facts</a> suggest that most of Cartagena’s citizens can trace their lineage to the city’s early indigenous settlers. The reason why the early settlers left was to escape the Spanish occupation. After driving the locals away, Spanish conquistadors found hoards of gold in the tombs of Cartagena, which prompted more people to flock to the city with the hopes of getting rich. </p>
    <p>The allure of riches has ultimately ascended a tiny village into a full fledged city. Now, the city is known for its rich but turbulent past.</p>

    <li><b>Totumo Mud Volcano</b></li>
    <p>For a unique spa experience, have a mud bath in El Totumo. The volcano has been dormant for some time now and inside is just a large natural vat of mud, which locals claim have healing properties. </p>
    <p>Locals also claim that the volcano used to be active until a priest blessed it with holy water. If you’re worried about the mess you’ll make after taking this mud bath, don’t worry. There’s a beach nearby where you can rinse yourself off. There are also locals willing to assist you in cleaning up; just remember to tip them accordingly. Your visit to Cartagena will not be complete if you didn’t take a dip in the muddy El Totumo.</p>

    <li><b>Sir Francis Drake’s House</b></li>
    <p>The famous mariner, Sir Francis Drake, attempted to take over the city during 1586. His initial attack was a success but he also lost most of his soldiers. So he took the city for ransom and demanded more money and gold. He waited for about two months before he got the ransom, in which he stayed in a house called Alonso Bravo. </p>
    <p>To this day, you can find a plaque bearing his name on the house. Visiting this house gives you a more in depth look at the city’s history, especially it’s rather tragic and sordid past.</p>

    <li><b>Rosario Islands</b></li>
    <p>One of the most popular <a href="/why-travel-to-cartagena.htm">things to do in Cartagena, Colombia</a> is to visit the Rosario Islands. Not only is it considered one of the most beautiful groups of islands in the Caribbean, it is also one of the most biologically diverse. </p>
    <p>Here you’d find dolphins, nurse sharks, sea horses, manta rays, and many others. In fact, the Rosario Islands have a total of 1,300 species of plants and animals. This is the perfect haven for nature lovers.</p>

    <li><b>Home to beautiful Colombian women</b></li>
    <p>If your trip to Colombia entails finding the love of your life, Cartagena is definitely the place to be. Not only is the city historically and culturally rich, it also has an abundance of stunning <a href="/women/cartagena-women/cartagena-women.htm">Colombian women</a>.</p>
    <p>If Cartagena isn’t in your Colombian itinerary yet, leaving this city out would be a huge mistake. Paying Cartagena a visit will not only leave you with memorable experiences, but you might also be leaving with a potential love affair.</p>
  </ul>
