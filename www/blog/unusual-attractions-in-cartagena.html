      <p> Cartagena, Colombia faces the Caribbean sea to the west. If you are looking up attractions in Cartagena and happen to stumble upon this article, you’re in for a treat!  </p>

      <p> There are many things to do in Cartagena as well as wonderful spots where you can spend your time relaxing and indulging yourself in the city’s beauty. We offer singles vacation tours if you ever want to experience the festivities up close.  </p>

      <p> Continue reading and we will walk you through the unusual attractions located in Cartagena: </p>

      <ol>

      <li><b> Volcan de Lodo El Totumo </b></li>

      <p> This famous mud volcano in Colombia is locally shortened to El Totumo. Disgusting? No, it is somewhat remarkable as locals say that it’s like taking a bath in chocolate.  </p>

      <p> There is an amazing local folklore of how this came to be, and the locals considered it a therapeutic bath because it contains lots of minerals and brings numerous health benefits, and at the very least, it cleans your pores as well as smoothens your skin. </p>

      <li><b> Abaco Libros y Cafe </b></li>

      <p> For all the bookworms out there, you will certainly love this place! When visiting Cartagena, don’t miss this little cafe that is an oasis on the narrow streets of the city’s Old Town.  </p>

      <p> It is a calm and quiet place where you can take a break from the crowds. Get cozy and  sip some hot coffee while enjoying yourself as you flip through the pages of hundreds of different books. </p>

      <li><b> The Palace of the Inquisition </b></li>

      <p> For those who have a hobby of looking up horrific things from the past or anyone who is curious about it, this is the perfect place for you. This famous building was once housed by the notorious Inquisition.  </p>

      <p> The palace is now a museum for tourists where it displays instruments for torture, some of which are not for the weak of heart. It also houses pre-Columbian pottery and other historical trajectories of the city using paintings, armaments, and even furniture and church bells. </p>

      <li><b> Convento de la Popa </b></li>

      <p> Do you want to feel like you’re on top of the world? Or at least on top of Cartagena? Try visiting this convent. Convento de la Popa is open for anyone who wants to explore, and it even houses a small religious museum. Enjoy the panoramic view of Cartagena’s skyline as well! </p>

      <li><b> Door Knockers of Cartagena </b></li>

      <p> To those who are curious about how the locals determine a resident’s social status or profession in the old days, try to “knock” this place out!  </p>

      <p> During the old times, there was a popular saying, “A tal casa tal aldaba,” which means, “To each house its door knocker.” This is referred to their practice for distinguishing people’s social statuses through the design of the door knockers. </p>

      <p> A fish or other sea creature-shaped knocker means the owner of the house was a member of the sea merchant community or other sea-related trading activities. </p>

      <p> A lion head-shaped knocker represents members of the army and other protectors of the city. </p>

      <p> The clergy, meanwhile, have hand-shaped knockers, and a lizard-shaped knocker symbolizes the homes of high society or anyone with some kind of royal connection. </p>

      <li><b> San Pedro Claver Museum and Cloisters </b></li>

      <p> This place is home to the bodily remains of San Pedro Claver, which are rested in an illuminated case under the church’s altar. He was the first person to be canonized in the New World as he dedicated his life tending to the enslaved.  </p>

      <p> He became known as the Apostle of the Blacks. Throughout the museum, religious works of art are displayed alongside pre-Colombian archaeological pieces that date back centuries.  </p>

      <li><b> KGB Cartagena </b></li>

      <p> If you want to experience an unusual place to eat and relax, we recommend KGB Cartagena, and it can be found in the <a href="https://cartagenawomen.com/blog/Fun-Facts-About-Cartagena-Colombia.html">Walled City</a> at the Northwest corner of Plaza Fernández de Madrid.  </p>

      <p> You get to experience Soviet memorabilia, and since the menu is somewhat limited and pricey, most customers usually go for drinks. </p>

      <li><b> Batería del Ángel San Rafael </b></li>

      <p> This place is ideal for those who love to take their time and walk around. This iconic citadel has a unique location which requires you to take the local ferry, walk through a small town, and climb up a mosaic pathway. There are several tunnels to explore and bats to avoid, but it is definitely worth it. </p>

      <li><b> The Circo Teatro of Old Cartagena </b></li>

      <p> Located on the outskirts of Old San Diego, you can find an abandoned bull ring that used to be an integral place for entertainment. The Circus Theater held bull fights, as well as plays, operas, and picturesque cities until it closed for good many years ago.  </p>

      <p> Even though the once vibrant institution of the city is now gradually falling apart and slowly fading away, it will continue to live on in the memories of those who packed its barreras crying, “Toro! Toro!” </p>

    </ol>
