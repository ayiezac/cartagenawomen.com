    <h1>Couple Appreciation Month: 5 Romantic Gifts for Your Colombian Girlfriend</h1>

    <p>Dating a Colombian woman takes effort and patience. They are not easily attracted to someone. But when they do, they give their all. They take romance seriously, just like how they value their relationship with their family and friends. So, if she agrees to be your girlfriend, treasure your relationship for eternity.</p>
    <p>This Couple Appreciation Month, shower her with all your love. You don’t have to buy her things that are beyond your budget. Remember that Colombian women don’t ask for much. They accept anything, as long as it is from the heart.</p>

    <h2> The Art of Giving</h2>

    <p>What are the gifts women usually ask for? It can be anything, actually. But this couple’s month, we have listed seven romantic <a href="https://www.cartagenawomen.com/blog/what-type-of-gifts-colombian-women-love-to-receive.html">gifts for your Colombian girlfriend</a>.</p>
    <p>Before diving into the list, consider that thoughtfulness is the key. This means that you should personalize your gift depending on the type of woman that she is.</p>
    <p>Don’t pigeonhole Colombian women as one. If you have been with your girlfriend, you surely know what she likes or hates. Use that knowledge to your advantage when choosing the perfect gift to give to your Colombian girlfriend.</p>
    <p>That said, here are a few ideas:</p>

    <h3>Write her a poem.</h3>

    <p>Nothing beats the old ways of writing a poem. It is not that expensive and is far more romantic than anything else. Whoever receives it will surely jump out of joy. So, try writing a love poem for your Colombian girlfriend on these national days for couples.</p>
    <p>You don’t have to be a poet to make her heart flutter. You only have to reminisce about the key moments in your relationship. Ask yourself: What caught your attention when you met her? What kind of principles does she have that prompt you to confess? What are some things that made you love her even more?</p>
    <p>If she’s the kind of woman who loves jokes or anything funny, then make your poem a funny one. Are there conversations in the past that made her laugh? Are there moments that left her laughing out loud? She’ll surely laugh when she hears you mentioning those.</p>
    <p>Lastly, write your poem with your best intention. You don’t have to follow all the rules of poetry. Look within your heart, and you’ll surely write one that will make her recall the beautiful moments in your relationship.</p>

    <h3> Cook her favorite food.</h3>

    <p>Is your Colombian girlfriend always the one cooking? Why not change it this couple months instead? Ask her to put down the spatula and let you do all the cooking.</p>
    <p>Colombian women have been raised to be the ones in charge of the kitchen. But your girlfriend won’t mind if you ask her to stop for a month and let you cook for her instead.</p>
    <p>Besides, it can be a good learning experience. It is easier if her favorite food is something you already know how to cook. But if it is not something you know how to prepare, you should do your research. You may not know it, but you are learning more about her than you may not know.</p>
    
    <h3> Send her flowers and chocolates.</h3>
    
    <p>Flowers and chocolates always go hand-in-hand. It is the usual thing boyfriends give to their girlfriend. However, that doesn’t mean that it’s not special. You just have to give the flowers and chocolates that your Colombian girlfriend likes.</p>
    <p>It all goes down to preference.</p>
    <p>Some women love red roses. Others prefer daisies and peonies. Then, there are also women who like receiving flowers that are one of a kind or ones that can only be seen in their region.</p>
    <p>This also goes with chocolates. Women who are into fitness prefer dark chocolates while others want white ones.</p>
    <p>If you don’t want to go through all the hassle of picking which is perfect for your Colombian girlfriend, ask her. Just don’t mention that you’re preparing something big these national days for couples.</p>
    
    <h3> Buy the clothes that she’s been eyeing.</h3>

    <p>Has your girlfriend been rambling about a specific dress lately? Is she collecting clothes from a specific brand?</p>
    <p>Girls love dressing up so much. They can go to a market dressed up like they are on a runway. This is a lifestyle for women.</p>
    <p>Here’s an idea: This Couple Appreciation Month, show your girlfriend that you’ve been paying attention by surprising her with the clothes that she has been wanting to get.</p>
    <p>If she’s not the type of girl that raves about dresses, but you still want to give her something, check what kinds of clothes she usually wears in her closet. Is it filled with dresses or hoodies?</p>
    <p>If you also want her to have at least something wonderful, then go for classic yet timeless pieces that will accentuate her body. You can even bring her to the clothing store and let her choose whatever she likes.</p>

    <h3> Give her a box of jewelry.</h3>

    <p><em>If you have the money, why not?</em></p>
    <p>Your gift doesn’t have to be a whole jewelry set. Just choose something that she likes or suits her best. Check her jewelry collection. Ask if she prefers rings, necklaces, bracelets, or all of these things. If she’s not into accessories, but you still want to give her something, look for the timeless pieces that fit her perfectly.</p>
    <p>If you want to add more meaning to your surprise, you can also personalize your gift. Add the date of your first meeting or the names you call each other. You can also buy jewelry for the two of you with your names written on each set. It is a perfect keepsake to remind you of your love for each other.</p>

    <p>Being in a <a href="https://www.cartagenawomen.com/blog/how-to-win-the-heart-of-cartagena-women.html">relationship with a Colombian woman</a> is not that difficult. You just have to know what she likes and hates. Understand that she pays more attention to the little things. She values the intimate aspects of your relationship more than the material ones.</p>
    <p>However, once in a while, make her feel special by celebrating the special days in a relationship with meaningful gifts. This doesn’t have to be extravagant or expensive. As long as it comes from the heart, that is all that matters.</p>
