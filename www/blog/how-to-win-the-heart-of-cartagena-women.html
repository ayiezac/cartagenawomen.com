  <p>Winning a woman’s heart takes courage and confidence. Just like any other lady in the world, <a href="/women/cartagena-women/cartagena-women.htm">Cartagena women</a> want to be understood and swept off their feet too. It doesn't need to be extravagant nor expensive though. All it requires is consistency and genuineness --- show this every day and no doubt, you'll win her heart in no time. </p>
 
 <p>The key here is trying to do your very best. And over time, those little efforts that you exert will go a long way. But if you don't have any idea how to win the heart of a <a href="/mp/latin-women.htm">Latin woman</a>, don't worry. We got your back. </p>

 <p>Without further ado, here are a few things that you need to keep in mind should you want to pursue a Latina's affection during our singles vacation: </p>

 <ul>
   <li><b>Be kind and genuine</b> - Colombian women show kindness and genuineness to anyone they meet. And they expect to be treated the same way. Try to make an effort to show that you really are. If she's not who you're looking for, don't play around. Instead, find that woman for you in the crowd. There are hundreds of other women seeking love with foreign men during our singles vacation. There's no rush, you can take as much time as you need. </li>

   <li><b>The little things matter, so pay attention</b> - If you really want to win her heart, keep in mind to always pay attention to the details. Try your best to be sensitive to her wants and needs. If she's frowning, ask her why --- that means she needs your attention. If she puts on make-up, compliment her. It's the little things that count. </li>

   <li><b>Ask her questions</b> - Let her feel that you're interested, you may throw some questions but never make her feel like she's in an interview. Check on the "right questions to ask" for you to know the appropriate questions for <a href="/women-in-cartagena.html">women in Cartagena</a>. Also, allow yourself to ponder on the answers she’s giving you. This way, you’ll have an idea of where to take her or what to do in your next dates. </li>

   <li><b>Tell her your story</b> - It doesn't have to be every detail of your life. What we mean by this is, tell her what you're up to as of this moment. That'll make her feel that she's involved with your life and that she's important. </li>

   <li><b>Dance with her</b> - Want to make her fall in love with you in an instant? Take her to the dance floor! You don't need to be a dance expert to go on Latin dancing with these ladies. Just move those feet, sway your hips, and smile. That'll make her think that you're charming.</li>
