  <p>The reason Latin dishes have such a unique flare is because they have the perfect fusion of Native American and European flavors. <a href="/why-travel-to-cartagena.htm">Colombian food</a> is pretty much the same only their dishes have more Amerindian influence. </p>

  <p>The country’s cuisine is just as diverse as well because each province has their own set of specialties. In the case of Cartagena, Colombia, a lot of its top dishes are seafood-based mainly because it is a port city. This is the perfect place to sample some quality seafood. But if you are craving for other dishes, here are some underrated Colombian dishes that you should try when you <a href="/helpful-itinerary-for-cartagena.html">travel to Cartagena</a>:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Pargo Frito</b></li>
    <p>This is the perfect dish to introduce you to Cartagena cuisine. The dish is comprised of deep-fried fish, a serving of coconut rice, fried patacones (plantains), and some salad on the side. It’s definitely one of the heaviest dishes they serve but it is also one of the heartiest. You would definitely be satisfied after having a plate of Pargo Frito.</p>

    <li><b>Cazuela de Mariscos</b></li>
    <p>Roughly translating to fish stew, this hearty soup is actually heavy on shellfish and shrimp with coconut milk as the base of the soup. However, there are places that would include shrimp and squid. </p>
    <p>The result is a salty savory but at the same time creamy soup which you generously slather over a serving of rice. It is the perfect dish on a cold day or even a starter for any meal.</p>

    <li><b>Posta Negra Cartagenera</b></li>
    <p>Aside from seafood, this is another staple that Cartagena is known for. At first glance, it may seem like a simple roast steak served with fried plantains and coconut rice. But the secret lies in its sauce. </p>
    <p>The dark sauce is actually made out of Worcestershire sauce, sugar, onion, garlic, cumin, brown sugar, and (surprisingly) soda. No Colombian food menu in Cartagena would be complete without this dish.</p>

    <li><b>Arepa de Huevo</b></li>
    <p>If you prefer a light breakfast or afternoon snack, then try this treat. This dish consists of corn arepas stuffed with raw eggs. They are then deep-fried until the egg inside is cooked. </p>
    <p>It is served together with suero which is a sour cream and chili sauce. These arepas do pack a hearty and heavy punch making you feel full in no time. This is probably the most favored Arepa Colombian food in the city.</p>

    <li><b>Mondongo Soup</b></li>
    <p>For those who are more familiar with Mexican cuisine, this dish would probably remind you of the Mexican Menudo, wherein chunks of beef, pork (even some chorizo), and choice vegetables are cooked until tender and then simmered in a thick and hearty stew. </p>
    <p>This dish is served in plenty of Cartagena restaurants so they are quite easy to find.</p>
  </ul>

  <p>What’s good about this list of Colombian food is that you can share them with friends both old and new. You can even sample them while you are out on a date with a beautiful Colombian woman. But in order to meet such a woman, you must take that first step by joining one of our <a href="/tour/cartagena/">singles tours to Cartagena, Colombia.</a> </p>
