  <p><a href="/cartagena-dating-culture.html">Dating advice</a> isn’t hard to come by these days. You can practically read hundreds, if not thousands, of dating advice for men online. The problem is that there’s no way to tell which one works and which doesn’t. Wouldn’t it be easier if there was someone to tell you what not to do? </p>
  
  <p>Well, you’re in luck because we’ve rounded up a list of dating no-nos according to experts (by experts, we mean some of the top matchmakers in the world).</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Overdoing your background checks.</b></li>
    <p>There’s nothing wrong with doing a bit of research. After all, it’s natural that you want to know the person you’re dating first before actually meeting her in the flesh. But make sure you don’t fall down the rabbit hole.</p>
    <p>Keep a certain level of mystery on those first few dates. Besides, there are just some things worth knowing in person than finding out on your own. This way, she can paint you a better picture of the things about her that you wish to know. This act of sharing can also bring you two closer.</p>

    <li><b>Rushing into things.</b></li>
    <p>Allow your budding <a href="/cartagena-women-in-love.html">romantic relationship</a> to progress naturally. Even if you think you two are meant for each other, let your date realize that on her own. In the meantime, get to know her more and do everything you can to get closer to her.</p>

    <li><b>Overanalyzing the date.</b></li>
    <p>Thinking too much wouldn’t do you any good. Whether you like it or not, you can’t predict the outcome of your date—nor can you control how it goes. You simply have to go with the flow and hope for the best. Some spontaneity can keep the date light and fun. Also, you wouldn’t want your date to think she’s in an interview as opposed to a romantic night out.</p>

    <li><b>Drinking too much.</b></li>
    <p>Too much alcohol can mess with your date. When you’re intoxicated, you might not be in complete control of your behavior. This increases the risk of unintentionally hurting your date or at least rubbing her the wrong way. While there’s nothing wrong with a little liquid courage, just make sure you remain sober enough to function throughout the entire date.</p>

    <li><b>Focusing too much on yourself.</b></li>
    <p>Pay attention to what she says and what she wants. If you make everything all about you, you’d come off as conceited and self-centered. Allow her to open up to you and indulge some of her requests. In short, always strive to be a gentleman whenever you’re out on a date.</p>

    <li><b>Pretending to be someone else.</b></li>
    <p>You don’t have to tell tall tales just to impress your date. It’s important to stay true to yourself so that you know whether she accepts you for who you really are. </p>

    <p>If you lie, she’ll find out eventually and you’ll only end up looking like a fraud.</p>
  </ul>

  <p>Now that you know what not to do, hopefully you’ll have a better chance of finally landing that dream date. And if you want to date <a href="/women/colombian/colombian-women.htm">Colombian women</a>, you’re exactly in the right place. </p>
 
  <p>Here at <a href="/new-cartagena-women.html">Cartagena Women</a>, you can meet, chat with and date single ladies from Cartagena all over Colombia right in the comfort of your home. Simply <a href="/sign-up.html">sign up</a> today and you could well be on your way into dating and eventually marrying a Colombian woman.</p>
