  <p>One of the hurdles of online dating is private messaging. First-time online daters dread this stage because of the many ways it could go wrong. You don’t have to end up on the same boat though. There are plenty of <a href="/cartagena-dating-culture.html">dating tips</a> that could help you figure out how to effectively communicate with <a href="/women-in-cartagena.html">Cartagena women</a> online.</p>

  <p>Messaging is an important step because it gives you the opportunity to get to know one another. If you’re interested in someone from <a href="/why-travel-to-cartagena.htm">Cartagena Colombia</a>, this is one of the few ways you could gauge your chemistry. Plus, it’s also a good sign if she keeps responding to your messages. There could be a chance that it would lead to something more serious.</p>

  <p>To keep those messages coming, here are some tricks you can use:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Message first</b></li>
    <p>This is one of the few dating tips for shy guys that can work wonders: Don’t be afraid to make the first move. Start with a standard greeting and see where it goes from there. If she doesn’t respond at all, then take that as your cue to move on to someone else. No point wasting your time and effort on someone who wouldn’t give you the time of day. If she does reply right away, then it could be the start of something special.</p>

    <li><b>Respond in a timely manner</b></li>
    <p>This can be a bit challenging, especially with the difference in time zones. For instances where you can’t respond on time, at least make sure to send your message at her most convenient time. This way, you wouldn’t seem like you’re ghosting her.</p>
    <p>It also wouldn’t hurt to explain your minor blunder. But make sure that you explain in a way that won’t seem overly defensive. Just give her a valid and honest reason why you weren’t able to reply right away and it’ll do the job just fine.</p>

    <li><b>Make use of open-ended responses</b></li>
    <p>With this strategy, not only do you get to know her more, but you also extend the length of the conversation. But make sure your replies aren’t monologues because this would seem like you are hogging the entire conversation. </p>
    <p>Whenever you reply, stick to one or two sentences at most. After all, you want to keep her engaged—not bored.</p>

    <li><b>Give her a break from time to time.</b></li>
    <p>As much as you want to keep the momentum going, you also don’t want to wear her out. It’s alright for your conversation to have pauses in between. So don’t immediately panic when she doesn’t reply. Perhaps she’s just crafting a response. </p>
    <p>If you hound her for responses all the time, you might come across needy, clingy, and insecure. Besides, you could use that extra time to think of other topics to talk about. </p>
  </ul>
  <p>Now, these might seem like basic dating tips, but they are quite good at keeping her engaged. In terms of keeping the conversation interesting, that would depend entirely on your personalities and chemistry. And if things go right, you might just form a special bond with her. With these simple hacks, you might be on your way to finding that special someone.</p>
