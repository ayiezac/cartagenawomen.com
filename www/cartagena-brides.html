        <h3>Cartagena Brides vs Western Brides</h3>

        <p>In terms of comparing Cartagena brides to typical Western brides, there are glaring differences that we can spot, especially when it comes to culture. Culture alone is a big difference. Next to it is family ties.</p>

        <p>As mention, Latin women highly value family ties. For them, family is everything. Many of Latin women live with their parents even after marriage. They love spending time with their entire family until they decide to move out of the house. When you marry a Latina, you’ll expect her to still connect with her family amidst everything, which is very different when it comes to Western brides.</p>

        <p>Most Western women are not family-oriented. They even used to live separately with from parents and can barely stand seeing them. You could really say that they are not as family-centered as Latin women.</p>

        <p>With regards to a relationship, many western women like to be in an open relationship where either can still woo while in a relationship. For Latinas, however, being in a relationship means committing fully to your partner. If you want to make your relationship work, she has to be the one and only woman you will be dating. That’s how it works for them.</p>

        <p>That being said, it is really best not just to know <a href="/how-to-meet-women-in-cartagena.html">how to meet women in Cartagena</a> but also the Colombian culture which plays a major role in your future relationship.</p>

        <h4>Wedding Traditions for Cartagena Women</h4>

        <p>Just like any other place, Cartagena has its own <a href="/cartagena-marriage-culture.html">marriage culture</a> which you should pay attention to when you want to marry a Latina. To give you a summary of how their marriage is done, here are some of their wedding traditions:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Colombian wedding traditions don’t usually have bridesmaids and groomsmen but rather, Godparents who will help them to be ready emotionally and financially. Godparents’ role is to also look out for the couple in their married life.</li>
            <li>Before the couple walks down the aisle, the groom must ask his bride’s family for her hand. The groom, together with his parents and Godparents, will visit his bride’s home and serenade her.</li>
            <li>After the wedding ceremony, the rituals will follow: Las Arras. This means you must be handed thirteen gold coins which you will exchange with your wife. This symbolism signifies that what is yours, will be shared with your wife.</li>
            <li>Then the lighting of the candles follows. You and your bride will light up each candle and all of the candles prepared for the ritual. This act symbolizes that both of you will be as one for the rest of your lives.</li>
            <li>Another wedding tradition is the shoe rite. Instead of throwing out a bouquet to determine who to wed next, all the bachelors in the wedding will take off their shoes and hide it beneath the bride’s dress. The bride will then pick one, and the owner of the chosen shoe will be the next person to tie the knot.</li>
            <li>Dances will also take place during the wedding rituals. This is the time where the bride and the groom will disappear from the reception. The first person to notice the couple’s disappearance will expect a fortune ahead. Otherwise, if there is no one to notice the disappearance, the couple will expect a piece of good luck for them in their marriage.</li>
        </ul>
