  <p>For men who have been eyeing Colombian women for the longest time, the question of whether they have what it takes to be a lifelong partner often comes to the surface. What do they want in a man and do you meet the qualifications? What does it take to go from being an acquaintance to someone’s lover, and how do you excel at becoming the perfect lover for a Colombian lady?</p>
  <p>It’s one thing for a woman to be head over heels for you and modify her existence to fit your personality and lifestyle, but that doesn’t always lead to a decent relationship, much less a passionate one. A passionate, love-filled relationship happens when both you and your partner are vulnerable to each other, where the give-and-take is so natural you become inseparable.</p>
  <p>The key is understanding the characteristics of a Colombian woman, knowing what they want in a man, and enhancing your best qualities to their satisfaction.</p>

  <h2>Understanding Colombian Women</h2>
  <p>Part of playing the game is knowing what the rules are. Remember, you aren’t just dating a woman because she is beautiful, you are dating the totality of who she is. The typical Colombian woman is known to be passionate, caring, thoughtful, and emotional.</p>
  <p>In other words, these ladies wear their hearts on their sleeves and are unabashed about expressing their feelings.</p>
  <p>There are men who might find this kind of personality a bit too much to handle, especially if they themselves don’t have the disposition or patience for that kind of woman. But there are in fact men who see this as the makeup for a colorful and exciting relationship. If you intend to date a Colombian woman, you might be the latter.</p>
  <p><a href="/blog/conveying-value-to-colombian-women.html"><strong>Colombian women</strong></a> are known to be flaky, spontaneous, and emotional. This isn’t something you can change, but rather accept and adapt to. It simply means that you need to be flexible and open to adventure. This means that your life is going to get all the more colorful.</p>

  <h2>Dating Colombian Women</h2>
  <p>Now that you know the kind of woman you intend to date, the key is being attractive enough to get her attention. If you are from the United States, Canada, or Western Europe, chances are the women there already have preconceived notions about you. Your job is to break down these barriers and get them interested in the only other person that matters - you.</p>
  <p>The first step is being an absolute gentleman. The old-fashioned way of romance is still something that appeals to Latin American people in general. The closer you are to the quintessential casanova, the better. Don’t let this discourage you, it’s simply about sticking to the basics.</p>
  <p>First, always practice good manners. The better your etiquette, the better impression you give. Practice basic chivalrous actions such as opening the door for your lady, paying for the date, and always saying thank you, or in this case, gracias.</p>
  <p>Always dress well and practice good grooming and hygiene. If you work out, that’s even better. Pick clothes that compliment your figure and keep your hair well-combed. When dating Colombian women, the basics are always a good place to start.</p>

  <h2>Going from a Regular Date to a Long-Term Lover</h2>
  <p>You’ve made a good impression by being a fine gentleman. You’ve gained her interest, so now you need to bring out the heavy guns. Now, before going any further, understand that <strong><em>being a lover doesn’t revolve around physical intimacy</em></strong>. Physical intimacy is the great bi-product of emotional intimacy, vulnerability, and security between two lovers. Focus on these things first and the rest will follow.</p>
  <p>Now back to the heavy guns. Confidence is key, so go with the winning attitude. Start with the conversation. Don’t stick to monosyllabic answers, but rather engage with her. Colombian women appreciate having a good conversation and good-hearted humor. In fact, if you feel the moment is right, you can venture into being a little flirtatious.</p>
  <p>Latinas in general love being dated the old-fashioned way, particularly when it comes to flirting. Remember, you aren’t there to be just a friend, so you need to make your romantic intentions known in a subtle yet teasing way. This is key, even if you are on an <a href="/blog/How-to-Engage-Cartagena-Women-Online.html"><strong>online dating</strong></a> site and exchanging words with the woman you’re interested in. Don’t stick to talking platonic, or worse, get into controversial topics like religion or politics. That’s not what you’re there for.</p>
  <p>Be a bit flirtatious by focusing on her and watching out for hints. Offer her a jacket if she feels cold, or “accidently” touch her hand. Gaze into her eyes and give her signs that she has your undivided attention.</p>
  <p><a href="/blog/women-from-cartagena-prefer-foreign-men.html"><strong>Women in Colombia</strong></a> love to dress up for even the most ordinary of occasions. On a date, expect to be stunned. Be mindful of the work they put in to look good and compliment them accordingly.</p>
  <p>Part of a good romance is engaging women where they identify. In this case, your best efforts at dancing and speaking Spanish are certain to endear Colombian ladies to you. Dancing is in the blood of every Latin American. Their dances are sexy, sensual, and exciting. You may not speak very good Spanish, nor possess suave dance moves, but rest assured if you try hard enough, a Colombian woman will more than appreciate the effort.</p>
  <p>Now, don’t be mistaken, all of these things aren’t just dating advice. They can be considered relationship advice as well, because to be with a Colombian woman is to continuously date her. Remember how colorful your life was going to be?</p>

  <h2>Forever Dating a Colombian Woman</h2>
  <p>Loving a Colombian woman means loving everything about her, especially her family. The dating tips above aren’t just useful for date nights, they will also help you navigate life around her family and friends. While they know you aren’t like other Colombian men, they will still welcome you into their lives and way of living.</p>
  <p>Start getting used to passion. Women in Colombia aren’t reserved about expressing the way they feel. If they feel happy, sad, excited, or fearful, they will make it as clear as the blue sky on a cloudless day.</p>
  <p>In order to be emotionally intimate with a woman like that, you need to make her feel like you are listening to her at all times. You need to continually treat being with her like a date, making her feel like the most special woman in the world. The pay-off is well worth it because she will love you unconditionally, whole-heartedly, and passionately.</p>
  <p>When dating these ladies, it’s important to keep the fire always burning. Don’t have the mentality of a partner. Have the mentality of a lover. Passion is the name of the game when it comes to Colombian women, and that’s one thing that’s never going to change.</p>
