    <p>Take advantage of your Colombian travel and experience it to its fullest by dating beautiful <a href="https://www.cartagenawomen.com/blog/qualities-colombian-women-desire-in-their-men.html">Colombian women</a>.</p>
    <p>In this article, we’ll talk about how you can safely and successfully enjoy this incredible country as a single and emotionally available male traveler.</p>
    <p>According to multiple travel blogs, Medellin,  Santa Marta, Cali, Bogota, and Cartagena are the top five cities to meet gorgeous women in Colombia.</p>
    <p>As the title suggests, we’ll be concentrating on Cartagena Colombia.</p>

    <h2> Best Places to Meet Single Ladies</h2>

    <p>There’s no shortage of attractive women in Cartagena. The city is flooded with them. You’ll find one each time you turn your head.</p>
    <p>The problem, however, lies with approaching these women. You can’t just walk up to one in a public space expecting she won’t get creeped out. That’s why location is important. There are places where you shouldn’t cold approach women, and there are places where it’s okay to, such as these public spaces below:</p>
    <p><strong>1.  Shopping Centers and Malls</strong> - It’s a decent place to start because it always has a crowd. Malls and shopping centers are filled with a diverse variety of women. You’ll meet university students, office workers, mall attendants, and other female shoppers. Plus, it’s a safer place to hit on women, since it’s inside, where there’s also security.</p>
    <p>These are five malls you should check out:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
      <p>San Fernando Mall. Address: Cra. 48 #31-99, Cartagena, Bolívar, Colombia</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Castella Mall. Address: Dg. 30-31, Cartagena, Bolívar, Colombia</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Mall Plaza El Castillo. Address: Av. Pedro De Heredia #Carrera 13, Cartagena</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Caribe Plaza Mall. Address: Barrio Pie de la Popa Calle 29D #22-108, Cartagena</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Bocagrande Square Mall. Address: Cra. 1 #12-118, Cartagena, Bolívar, Colombia</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>2.  Beaches and Resorts</strong> - Because the city is on the Caribbean coast, it has an abundance of white sand beach resorts with clear blue ocean waters.</p>
    <p>With that comes thousands of beach babes rocking skin-tight bikinis while frolicking on the beach front. It’s impossible not to enjoy yourself here. Check out these crowded beaches:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
      <p>Hotel Bocagrande Beach Resort</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Isla Punta Arena at Tierra Bomba</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Manzanillo Del Mar Beach Resort</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>3.  Night Clubs and Salsa Bars</strong> - The best place to experience Cartagena nightlife is in the Old Town. It’s the party center of the city. Here, you’ll find friendly Latinas who don’t mind being hit on by a gringo.</p>
    <p>Since the whole place is secure and well lit, it’s generally quite safe to explore at night.</p>

    <h2> The Art of Attracting Cartagena Women</h2>

    <p>Besides the obvious answers such as: be a gentleman, act respectful, look your best, and be charming, take note of these useful and effective tips when <a href="https://www.cartagenawomen.com/blog/start-online-dating-cartagena-colombia.html">dating in Cartagena</a>:</p>
    <p><strong>1.  Speak her language</strong> - You don’t have to be fluent, just enough to be conversational. To get you started, below are a few Spanish phrases you can use on your date:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
      <p><em>“Te ves muy bien.”</em> which translates to “You look great.”</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p><em>“¿Te estás disfrutando?”</em> which translates to “Are you having a good time?”</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p><em>“¿Qué vas a hacer más tarde? ¿Te gustaría salir?”</em> which translates to “What are you doing later? Would you like to go out?”</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p><em>“¿Te gustaría bailar?”</em> which translates to “Would you like to dance?”</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p><em>“¿Quieres que te acompañe a la casa?”</em> which translates to “Would you like me to walk you home?”</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Being able to speak the local language will make a great difference when dating the local women since not a lot of them are able to speak any other language besides it.</p>
    <p><strong>2.  Invest in a Salsa class</strong> - Colombians love to dance, especially the women in Cartagena. They can appreciate a gringo who can accompany them on the dancefloor. Knowing the basic steps is enough. But if you want to be extra, take a dancing class. There are tons of places in the city that offer the course, such as these two places below:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
      <p>Donde Fidel Salsa Bar | Portal de los Dulces, Carrera 4, Cartagena, Colombia</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Bazurto Social Club | Carrera 9 #30-42, Cartagena, Colombia</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>3. Be bold and confident</strong> - Don’t be timid. Shyness won’t get you anywhere - at least with women in Colombia. They prefer men who can take charge and make them feel pursued. When approaching Colombian women in public spaces, you need to exude confidence and show assertiveness.</p>

    <h2> Tips for a Safe Cartagena Dating Experience</h2>

    <p>Is Cartagena Colombia safe for single men looking for love?</p>

    <p><strong>1.  Be cautious of gold diggers</strong>. Like all countries in the world, there will always be a group of people who take advantage of tourists, Colombia is no exception. We’re not saying there’s a lot of them in the country. While there are only a few of them, it’s best to be wary and watch out for red flags or suspicious behaviors.</p>
    <p><strong>2.  Avoid approaching women who are clearly taken</strong>. When you do, a fist-fight is bound to happen. Colombian men will not back out from a fight. They consider women to be their property. If you try to steal their girl away, prepare for a brawl. If you ask us, it’s never worth it. Hence, avoid it at all costs.</p>
    <p><strong>3.  Always opt to meet in a public place</strong>. Don’t go exploring the dark and narrow alleyways at night by yourself. Always pick public spaces to meet and date women. If possible, choose places where there’s security on standby.</p>
    <p><strong>4.  Inform someone about your whereabouts</strong>. Let a close friend or family member know where you are at all times. In case of worst case scenarios, they’ll know what to tell police officials.</p>
    <p><strong>5.  Share minimal personal details</strong>. Being too trusting with your personal information can lead to scams. Be careful who you share your personal information with.</p>
    <p><strong>6.  Lastly, use common sense and trust your instincts</strong>. Wherever you are in the world, be it Cartagena or any other foreign city, it’s always best to exercise caution.</p>
