      <p> Pursuing a lady is one of the challenges any man will go through in winning the hearts of <a href="/women-in-cartagena.html">Cartagena women</a>. But before you do, check out for signs if she's attracted to you. Of course, you can't just walk up to a woman in Cartagena who barely knows you and confess your feelings and expect her to welcome you with both hands wide open. </p>

      <p> Furthermore, there are some signs that she's into you that is less obvious than most. Colombian women are very conservative and would often wait for men to make the first move. But that doesn't mean that they wouldn't make themselves available. As simple as dancing beside you or passing in front of you or even looking at you from afar, these are signs that she's attracted to you. So keep a lookout for these opportunities. </p>

      <p> If she does, then here are the secrets to winning a Latina's heart: </p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>State your intentions</b> - Should you take part in our <a href="/tour/cartagena/">singles vacations</a>, be mindful that all the ladies who took part of it are seeking a long term relationship with foreign men and not for a one night stand. And if you're not looking for commitment, then this isn't the right site for you. </li>
        <p>But if you do, let her know that you think of her as a potential. Be true to your feelings. Don't say things that you don't really mean. There are hundreds of ladies that will be present during our singles vacation and you have all the time you need to choose your match among them. Don't worry, our professional matchmakers will also be there to help you.  </p>

        <li><b>Tell her about you</b> - Sharing details about yourself is the most effective way of encouraging a Latina to open up with you about her life. And as little it may be, this will make her feel trusted and really special. Avoid bragging about your money though, as ladies who take part in our singles vacation are mostly independent and will not fall for such. </li>

        <li><b>Don't take advantage of her</b> - You may notice that most ladies in Cartagena are very friendly and would even dance wildly with you. But that's just part of their culture. Never ever take advantage of her kindness by asking her for sexual favors as it's definitely a deal breaker for Latin women.</li>

        <li><B>Surprise her</B> - Dating in Cartagena doesn't need to be extravagant but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't make an effort in wooing her. So, surprise her with little well-thought gifts. But to be able to pull this off, you need to pay extra attention during your conversation with her. Also, it's one thing to give flowers but they are perishable. We suggest going for gifts that will make her think of you always. </li>

        <li><B>Be a little mysterious</B> - Keep the thrill alive. Keep her guessing. By this, you'll make her wonder why you are so different from the other men who tried to pursue her.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>There you have it! Now, you’re ready to win the hearts of Cartagena women. Taking part in our singles vacations is the key! <a href="/members/signup">Sign up</a> for free today! </p>
