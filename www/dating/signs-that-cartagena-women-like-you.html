  <p>Sometimes the things that <a href="/women/cartagena-women/cartagena-women.htm">Latin women</a> do during the first date are something they do intentionally for you to have a hint that they like you. Other times they're done subconsciously. </p>

  <p>Either way, it's still incredibly challenging to figure out if a Latina really likes you or not. So we made a list of the common signs that Colombian women give out when they're into you. Here are some of them: </p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Body language</b> - If she's sitting straight and she's leaning towards the table facing you, it's one of the obvious signs that she's definitely into you. That also means she's giving you her full presence and attention and is eager to know more about you. </li>

    <li><b>When she touches you</b> - Research says that people often touch the person they like. As simple as her touching your shoulders or hands, that clearly means that she wants to be pursued by you. But be careful not to take it as a sexual invitation. It’s just how Latin girls, especially <a href="/new-cartagena-women.html">women in Cartagena</a> show their interest and affection.</li>

    <li><b>She's nervous or shy</b> - If it's your first date, it's only normal for her to feel this way around you. If you can't tell if she is, here are the signs you should look for to see if she's nervous: </li>
      <ul>
        <li>Her eyes blink more frequently.</li>
        <li>She often compresses her lips.</li>
        <li>She plays with her hair.</li>
        <li>She keeps on rubbing her hands.</li>
        <li>She checks her face occasionally in her mirror. </li>
      </ul>
      
    <p>When you notice this, try to break the ice with a joke. That’ll make her feel more comfortable. </p>

    <li><b>She plays with her hair most of the time</b> - A woman who likes you will unintentionally play or touch her hair a lot when she is with you. It could mean a few things: she's probably fixing her hair because she wants to look beautiful in front of you or she's just simply nervous. </li>

    <li><b>She's all smiles</b> - When <a href="/women/cartagena-women/cartagena-women.htm">Cartagena women</a> are in love, you’ll notice it because her smile will radiate with a different kind of positive and romantic aura. When you see her grinning from ear to ear, that’s an indicator that she’s having fun with you which could also consequently mean that she’s really into you. </li>

    <li><b>She lingers close to you</b> - One of the things you should carefully observe, should you take part in the best singles vacation in town is a Latina standing or sitting close to you. This woman might just be waiting to be noticed by you. And there's an easy way to confirm that. Try to check if she's staring at you. If she is, try to give her a smile. If she smiles back, she's definitely into you. </li>
    <p>If this is the case, try to get her to dance with you, Latinas are passionate about dancing. Don't worry if you don't have the moves. Just smile and she'll think you're adorable. </p>
  </ul>
