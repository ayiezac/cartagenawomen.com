         Make sure that you ask the right questions to Colombian women on the first dates!
      </cite>
  </div> 

        <p> There’s always a possibility of awkward silence when going out on a first date. Perhaps it’s the first time for both of you to hear each other’s voices or somehow you run out of conversation starters. Either way, there are many reasons behind bad first dates. But there’s one way you can prevent that from happening, and that is keeping the date from becoming boring. </p>

        <p> You can kickstart the date with good conversation topics for texting a girl  (or ask her the right questions in person), you’ll not only make it fun but you’ll also enjoy quality conversation with your Colombian date on the first date. </p>

        <p> While the first few dates are mainly about getting to know each other, make sure you don’t let the conversation feel like an interrogation with <a href="https://cartagenawomen.com/blog/conveying-value-to-colombian-women.html">Colombian women</a> by asking the most important questions in a lighthearted way. If you want to know your Colombian girl better, ask her meatier questions aside from asking about the weather. </p>

        <p> Particularly, raise questions that will make her feel close to you, giving you the opportunity, as well, to discover who she really is. Here are some <a href="https://cartagenawomen.com/blog/avoid-awkward-silence-when-dating-colombian-women.html">first date questions</a> that can serve as conversation starters with a girl in Colombia (these also apply when you’re still on the stage of online chat): </p>
         
        <p> <b> What is the strangest fear that you have?</b> </p>

        <p> If you want to make her comfortable about showing her vulnerability, <a href="https://www.mantelligence.com/personal-questions-to-ask-a-girl/">this question is your first bet</a>, though this can lead to one of two results–fun and weird. But most women would regard this as a fun question. Who knows? You might have the same unusual fear</p>
         
        <p> <b>What is your favorite movie/TV show?</b> </p>

        <p> As clichè as this question is, it does lead to some enjoyable conversations, especially when you enjoy the same shows. If it is, then you will have a great deal to talk about. But if not, then you both have movie/TV show recommendations for each other.
         
        <p><b>What book or movie character do you find yourself most similar to?</b> </p>

        <p> This question lets you know how your <a href="https://cartagenawomen.com/blog/secrets-to-winning-cartagena-womens-hearts.html">Colombian woman</a> views herself or who she wants to be like. If you want to be more specific, you can even divide the question into two–which character she wants to be and which one she’s really actually like. 
         
        <p><b>What are you passionate about right now?</b> </p>

        <p> Any person is at their most attractive state when they talk about things that they really love. This question can get you to the very core of her existence. As a follow up question, you can also ask her what she wishes she is actually more passionate about.
         
        <p><b>What’s something that you just can’t get good at?</b> </p>

        <p> You can know a lot about a person with this. On the other hand, sharing about your weaknesses can help you feel closer to each other, especially when you accept her flaws as well as her strengths.
         
        <p><b>What’s your family’s weirdest tradition?</b> </p>

        <p> Every family always has its own strange customs, traditions, and even superstitious beliefs. This is a great question when you want to know more about her family.
         
        <p><b>What’s the best thing about where you grew up?</b> </p>

        <p> You can make her feel more comfortable by asking this question. If she should be your <a href="https://cartagenawomen.com/blog/women-from-cartagena-prefer-foreign-men.html">Colombian wife</a> someday, then you might as well ask her things that would give you insight about her past, her family, and how she was raised.
         
        <p><b>What were you like as a kid?</b> </p>

        <p> This can be one of the funny random questions you can ask her. Was she a rascal, a bookworm, or a cheerleader? You can even tease her about whether you would’ve been enemies or friends had you met when you were kids. Anyhow, this always leads to a fun conversation.
         
        <p><b>Which is the most interesting place you have been?</b> </p>

        <p> This question lets you know if she likes traveling or not. If you love to travel, it’s important to know beforehand so that she doesn’t feel left behind. For a follow up, ask her if she has traveled much already (if not, does she want to).
         
        <p><b>What crazy adventure have you been to most recently?</b> </p>

        <p> Knowing how much of a thrill-seeker she is will help you determine your next step. If she’s more adventurous, then you may try to progress your relationship more quickly. But if not, you may need to take it slow and build more rapport with her beyond small talk.
         
        <p><b>Is what you’re focusing right now what you want to do forever?</b> </p>

        <p> You might want to know what her ambitions are. Whether she’s content with her 9-5 job, or if her goal is pretty wild, it speaks a lot about her. It’s important to know what her goals are so you find out if you don’t want the same things, especially when you’ve already accomplished what you want in life.
         
        <p><b>What’s the most valuable thing in your life?</b> </p>

        <p> You’ll know if she’s materialistic or not when she’s obsessed with designer brands. That’s how you know she can really get very materialistic. If she says it’s her cat or dog, then you know that she’s a huge pet lover. Whatever her answer is, at least you know what she values most.
         
        <p><b>What aspect of your culture are you least or most proud of?</b> </p>

        <p>In an interracial relationship, being open about her cultures and traditions will make her be more interested in you. After all, her culture largely made up who she is now. Letting her talk about her culture will make you see how different or similar your backgrounds are.</p>
         
        <p><b>What impact did a random stranger leave in your life?</b> </p>

        <p> This question is thought-provoking because it makes her think about her previous experiences. Just don’t forget to follow up with details about her story or if there are other random strangers who might have left the same kind of impact. If you’ve had a similar experience, share it with her, too.
         
        <p><b>What activities/tasks do you find interesting or boring?</b> </p>

        <p> This lets you know what bores her and what stimulates her (to the point she’s not able to recognize the time passing). Ask her follow up questions as to which activities or tasks she finds boring or interesting. This will help you know where to go and what to do for the next date.</p>
         
        <p> Asking any of these questions while on dates with <a href="https://cartagenawomen.com/blog/conveying-value-to-colombian-women.html">Colombian women</a> makes the experience engaging and interesting.</p>
