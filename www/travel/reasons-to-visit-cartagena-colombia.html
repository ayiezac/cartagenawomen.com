  <p>There’s a reason why <a href="/why-travel-to-cartagena.htm">Cartagena tourism</a> is on the rise. Aside from the fact that it is one of the most beautiful cities in Colombia, the locals also make it one of the most tourist-friendly areas in the country. </p>

  <p>But aside from the beautiful scenery and friendly people, Cartagena is also touted as home to some of Colombia’s most beautiful women - an underrated element of what makes Cartagena such an appealing destination.</p>

  <p>While beauty is indeed subjective, if you’d ask any man if they find <a href="/women-in-cartagena.html">Colombian women</a> hot and attractive, we bet that almost every single one of them would say yes. </p>

  <p>So if you want to go on a trip to a destination with awe-inspiring scenery, warm and hospitable people while also trying your luck at dating a Colombian woman, <a href="">Cartagena, Colombia</a> is definitely the place to be.</p>

  <p>If you’re thinking, however, that that’s all Cartagena has to offer, you’d be gravely mistaken. There are tons of other tourist attractions and exciting activities to be had in the city. </p>

  <p>Below are 5 often overlooked reasons to visit Cartagena, Colombia:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>A fusion of old and new</b></li>
    <p>While Cartagena is considered a modern city, there are some areas that look and feel like it’s frozen in time. Places like the UNESCO-protected Old Town and Bocagrande still feel like they’re stuck in the Spanish-colonization era. </p>
    <p>But when you head into the city, you feel like you’re back in modern civilization. In a way, it feels like you can travel back in time. </p>
    <p>The fact that they are paving the way forward but still keeping in touch with the past shows how much the city values its heritage.</p>

    <li><b>Colorful fixtures</b></li>
    <p>Cartagena is one of the most colorful cities in Colombia. Not only do they have vibrant plants and flowers, but they also paint their houses and landmarks in vibrant blues, reds, and greens. </p>
    <p>A lot of the surviving Spanish era architecture is painted with vivid and vibrant colors making the colorful aesthetic of the city very pleasing to the eyes.</p>

    <li><b>Quirky rides</b></li>
    <p>Getting around the city is just as memorable and exciting as the sights and attractions are pretty. </p>
    <p>When you travel around the city, make sure to board some Chiva buses. They were used for public transport, however, now they are just used for select tours. </p>
    <p>Some of the unique features of the Chiva bus include a side ladder, pew-like seats, and the sound system for the tour guide. You definitely won’t forget getting on board this bus.</p>

    <li><b>Seafood heaven</b></li>
    <p>While there are plenty of dishes worth trying, you should especially try the seafood. Expect them not only to be savory, but fresh as well.</p>
    <p>Due to Cartagena’s location which faces the Caribbean Sea, one of the city’s major industries is fishing. Thus, it comes as no surprise that seafood is the highlight of the city’s cuisine.  </p>
    <p>Two of the most famous dishes in the city include Cazuela de Mariscos and Camarones al Ajillo. They also have their own version of Ceviche, which is a common South American seafood salad.</p>

    <li><b>Gorgeous beaches</b></li>
    <p>Your Cartagena trip would not be complete if you don’t visit the world-famous Cartagena beaches. And who would resist this jewel of the Caribbean? </p>
    <p>Some of the more popular beaches are found in Bocagrande and La Boquilla. But you can also hit the waves of Playa Blanca, Isla Grande, and Tierra Bomba.</p>
    <p>Just imagine yourself sipping on your margarita while lounging on a white sand beach watching the sun sets into the horizon. </p>
  </ul>

  <p>While we can list down the many great things about Cartagena, there’s nothing like experiencing the sights and sounds yourself. If you decide to visit, it’ll be one of the most memorable places you’ll ever get to experience.</p>

  <p>Not many people know that Cartagena is also a city of romance. Here you’ll meet some of the most beautiful women in this corner of the globe. </p>

  <p>Many bachelors from all over the world visit Cartagena not only to relax and enjoy, but also to fall in love. They visit the city with the hopes of meeting a single Colombian lady whom they can eventually marry. </p>

  <p>Contrary to how they are usually portrayed in TV and films, Colombianas are actually intelligent, cultured, and faithful women. Their feminine characteristics make them ideal partners for a lot of men.</p>
