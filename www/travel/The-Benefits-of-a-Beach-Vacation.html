  <p><a href="/why-travel-to-cartagena.htm">Cartagena Colombia</a> is known for its cultural and historical heritage. With such a rich, vibrant and colorful cultural heritage, UNESCO declared the city as a World Heritage Site. But since it is located along the Caribbean, it’s no surprise that it also has some exotic beaches. Some of the more well-known are Rosario Islands, Playa Blanca, and Tierra Bomba.</p>

  <p>It goes without saying that one of the <a href="/helpful-itinerary-for-cartagena.html">things to do in Cartagena Colombia</a> is visiting its beaches. Generally speaking, going to the beach is always a treat. After all, what’s not to love when you hit the waves, soak up the sun, and build castles on the sand (especially when they’re Cartagena Colombia beaches)? But did you know that there are other benefits to having a beach vacation?</p>

  <p>Here are just a few of them:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><b>It reduces stress levels</b></li>
    <p>Going to the beach isn’t just figuratively good for you—it turns out it’s actually good for you. A study conducted by Michigan State University found that our brains process natural backdrops better because there are fewer sensory stimuli (basically fewer distractions). This, in turn, boosts mental relaxation, which ultimately lessens stress. No wonder those beach wallpapers are so popular.  </p>

    <li><b>Helps improve your skin</b></li>
    <p>It turns out sea water can be pretty good for your skin. Seawater is known to mildly treat psoriasis. This explains why people with this condition are advised to frequent the beach. Soaking up the sun allows you to absorb vitamin D (but only during the early morning) as well. </p>

    <li><b>Encourage a more active lifestyle</b></li>
    <p>Swimming is an effective form of exercise. It builds muscle strength and boosts circulation. It is also known to help improve your breathing and burn calories. But swimming isn’t the only activity you can experience at the beach. You can kayak, sail, surf, and the list goes on and on. Doing these activities might help you lose some pounds and improve your overall health.</p>

    <li><b>Eat healthily</b></li>
    <p>Shellfish, seaweed, fish, and many more. Not only are they delicious, but they are also considered some of the healthiest. For example, abalone and oysters are rich in Omega 3 and 6 while wild salmon and trout are high in healthy fat. If you are open to trying something more exotic, how about having some octopus? It is rich in protein and Omega 3 and 6 too.</p>

    <li><b>Boosts your mood</b></li>
    <p>Regardless of whether you are simply relaxing under the sun or you engage in water activities, you always find yourself having a good time while out on the beach. This drastic change in mood could also combat depression and anxiety. So if you need a pick-me-up from work, perhaps a trip to a Cartagena beach is all you need to lift up your spirits.</p>
  </ol>

  <p>To think, these are just some of the health benefits of a beach vacation. In terms of romance, the beach is just the perfect getaway for a romantic rendezvous with <a href="/women-in-cartagena.html">Colombian women</a>. And because Cartagena Colombia weather is mainly tropical almost all year round, you can visit Cartagena any time of the year. So when you head to Cartagena, definitely make a stop at one of its beautiful beaches.</p>
