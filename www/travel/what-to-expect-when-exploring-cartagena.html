    <p>Formerly called Cartagena de Indias by Spanish conquistadors, this lovely, vibrant, and culturally rich city in Colombia is a favorite international destination among travelers coming from all over the world.</p>
    <p>Incredible beaches, picturesque locations, savory food, fun local attractions, and beautiful Colombian women; this city has it all and more.</p>
    <p>With that said, consider <a href="https://www.cartagenawomen.com/blog/cartagena-tourism-why-visit-cartagena.html">exploring Cartagena</a>. There are so many things to do and see in this colonial city. Check out the list below to start planning your Colombia trip.</p>
    <h2> The Old City is a sight to behold!
    </h2><p>Medellin has Plaza Botero, Barranquilla has Carnaval de Barranquilla, and Bogota has its luscious parks and ecological reserves. What about Cartagena? What does it have that makes it worth visiting?</p>
    <p>With confidence, Cartagena’s Old City is the principal attraction.</p>
    <p>It might not have iconic monuments, grandiose festivals, or natural attractions, but the city itself still draws thousands of tourists. It’s easily one of the most majestic and scenic cities in South America.</p>
    <p>Upon entering the Old City, you’ll be greeted by colorful and vibrant houses. Besides the phenomenal and distinct colonial architecture, you’ll also find a wide selection of bars and restaurants for when you get tired from walking.</p>
    <p>Here are some suggestions of things to do while in the Old City of <a href="https://www.cartagenawomen.com/blog/Things-to-do-in-Cartagena-Colombia.html">Cartagena Colombia</a>:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
      <p>Sign up for a walking tour. It’s one way to get exercise while learning new things about a place.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Be on the lookout for bright-colored, large, and ornate doors. Take pictures and save them for Instagram.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Pose for a photo with the iconic clock tower or Puerta del Reloj. You can find it at the entrance.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>As a day ender, book an al fresco dining experience at Cafe del Mar. They have the best view of the sunset.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2> You can take pictures with the iconic palenqueras.</h2>

    <p>They’re known as Colombia’s famous fruit ladies and Cartagena’s unofficial poster girls. Almost every <a href="https://www.cartagenawomen.com/blog/unusual-attractions-in-cartagena.html">Colombian travel</a> magazine has a page dedicated to them.</p>
    <p>Typically, these are local women who take on the role of a palenquera. They’re seen wearing brightly colored and loose dresses, with their signature basket of fruit effortlessly balanced on their heads. You’ll find them roaming around the streets of the Walled City since their main livelihood is posing for photos for tourists.</p>

          Aside from the street food, try the exotic fruits. Fruit ladies can be found anywhere in Cartagena. | Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@ripato" target="_blank">Ricardo Gomez Angel</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/lexRTRXv-ok" target="_blank">Unsplash</a>

    <p>They’re very warm and friendly. If you see one, don’t be afraid to ask for a photo. But remember, photos with them are not free, so don’t forget to tip them afterward.</p>
    <p>Taking photos without their knowledge is strongly discouraged. It’s disrespectful, not to mention you’re depriving them of their right to earn income. Be a good tourist and tip.</p>
    
    <h2> Local street food can be found anywhere in the city.</h2>

    <p>Though you’ll find plenty of luxurious yet affordable restaurants in the city, don’t ignore the street food scene. Give street vendors and their food a chance. You’ll find an abundance of them scattered throughout the city’s streets. For starters, try out these interesting fares:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
      <p>Fresh fruit stalls - Colombia is blessed with tropical fruits since it’s near the equator. Most of those sold in stalls and carts are guaranteed fresh and organic, so give it a try. One way to fight the blazing Colombian heat is a fresh jugo de coco. Buy a whole coconut and quench your thirst with its juice. Have the vendor carve the coconut meat out for you after.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Tinto carts - It’s a little mobile kiosk that sells gum, cigarettes, snacks, and the famous cafe con leche. Tinto carts are ubiquitous. You’ll find them everywhere, especially in parks. They’re also very cheap. The coffee they serve is stored in a thermos, and rest assured it’ll be warm and soothing. This may be one of the best non-touristy  things to do in Cartagena  you could try.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Ceviche - It’s marinated raw fish that’s drenched in spices and lime juice. One of the must-try foods in Cartagena. Most seafood sold in stalls and restaurants in this city is guaranteed freshly caught from the Caribbean sea. Shops that specialize in ceviche can be found in the old colonial city.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2> The fascinating street art in the Getsemani neighborhood will not disappoint!</h2>

    <p>Barrio Getsemani is a laid-back neighborhood where most tourists on a budget go to drink beer, listen to street musicians, snack on grilled arepas, and take pictures of incredible street art and murals.</p>
    <p>It only takes you 10 minutes to walk there from the Old City. It’s clean, budget-friendly, and there are tons of interesting things to do.</p>

    <h2> There are many exotic islands and beautiful beach resorts for you to visit.</h2>

    <p>There aren’t a lot of picturesque white-sand beach resorts within the city. If there is one, it’s most probably crowded with locals and tourists. It’ll be hard to enjoy it. The best option you have is to go island hopping.</p>
    <p>Take a boat excursion and explore Cartagena’s many tropical islets. Here are two must-visit islands:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
      <p>Playa Blanca - It’s an islet that’s a few meters away from the city’s coastline. It has a gorgeous beachfront that’s covered with fine white sand.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Islas del Rosario - In English, it is called Rosario Islands. This archipelago is made up of 27 white sand islets. It’s surrounded by clear, blue, and pristine waters, perfect for snorkeling, scuba diving, and sunbathing.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Other fun and exciting things to do in Cartagena.</h2>

    <p>There are just so many things to do and places to see that it’s not possible to enumerate them all. However, we can suggest these three additional things you should do while in Cartagena:</p>
    <p><strong>1.  Rumba on a Chiva Party Bus</strong> - Dance to traditional Colombian music, drink unlimited alcohol, and eat amazing local food while being chauffeured through historic neighborhoods in Cartagena. The Chiva Bus is an interesting take on nightlife on wheels.</p>
    <p><strong>2.  Take a volcanic mud bath</strong> - Volcan del Totumo is merely a few minutes away from Cartagena. It’s a famous tourist spot where visitors can enjoy a mud bath inside the volcanic crater. It only costs four dollars, which is a quite reasonable price considering it’s such a unique experience.</p>
    <p><strong>3. Go bargain hunting  and  souvenir shopping</strong> - Finish your Cartagena trip with a shopping spree. Take your time looking for handcrafted local items as they make great souvenirs for friends and family back home. If you prefer a more modern shopping experience, head down to one of the city’s biggest shopping malls, Mallplaza Cartagena - El Castillo.</p>
