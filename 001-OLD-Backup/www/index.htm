					about his experience in Cartagena:

							<I>Hi John, I just returned from the Cartagena tour & thought I'd write a brief letter regarding the tour. I enjoyed the Cartagena tour immensely, it was the perfect place 
							to go, excellent beach, perfect climate & beautiful & friendly ladies. </I>
						</P>
						<P align="justify">
							<I>Cartagena is not the Colombia everyone is accustomed to hearing about, I would describe it as a beautiful, tropical paradise & I hope to return at least once or twice 
							by year's end. I am going to recommend your tour a couple of friends whom are interested in traveling to Colombia. My Cartagena pictures have already changed a few minds 
							about traveling to Colombia, or at least Cartagena, all said it looks like a beautiful city, & I agree. </I>
						</P>
						<P align="justify">
							<I>Your AFA staff in Cartagena was great, they did an excellent job on the socials & the other excursions, Rafael & the staff made us feel very welcome. The translators 
							were great, all were good people. I would like to mention one in particular, Roberto, I have only good things to say about this translator. His English-translation abilities 
							& people skills were second to none. He made life very easy with the language barrier between myself & the ladies. He had good intuition & created an environment of dialogue 
							with myself & the ladies. </I>
						</P>
						<P align="justify">
							<I>When I return, I would hope Roberto could help me once again with my visit to see Yanin. I also would like to say I appreciate AFA for their tours that allow us to meet 
							wonderful women of other cultures & see different parts of this world. Many Thanks. </I>

					Thank YOU Terry! Terry's experience is just ONE of the countless stories we hear all the time. A <a class="bodyLinks" href="/tour/cartagena/">Cartagena romance tour</a> will give you an entirely 
					new perspective on dating. It opens up an entire new world of possibilities. 
				<p align=justify>
					Just a short 2 hour flight from Miami, Cartagena, Colombia is one of the most striking cities in all of South America. It serves as a major tourist destination 
					for many that live in Colombia and the surrounding countries. You will experience everything this magical city has to offer during your 11-day Romance Tour, but even that experience 
					will pale in comparison to the beautiful, passionate, sincere women you will be meeting throughout the tour. So why not join us.......for some warm Latin nights 
					and hot Latin spice?
